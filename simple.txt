I got you kinda! I got you kinda! Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar. Stupid assholes! How come nobody has a crime to solve? My God... What have you got, Marsh? Jesus, we're too late. Slowly the rage built inside his mind. "Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!" His only solution became obvious: Kill her! Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. The torso he would dump into the lake. And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie. Looks like the game is over, old man! Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington. Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all. And get us some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass! Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll. No sign of forced entry. We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room. Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over! Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat. Right. I think I know exactly where to start. Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?! Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! You're going down, Butters! You hear me?! You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying! Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup! Stop playing games! That does it! Wait right here! Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body. I don't know. I was hoping you guys did. Really? Oh okay. Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?! Follow me to the bathroom. Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup. Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it! Well, Butters?! Well pull harder! Try doin' it faster. Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?! The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes! Let's go! Kyle! I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew! Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them. Why not? Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got! Yeah! This was our hot lead! Dammit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off! All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo! Wwwaaahhh! We got her back safe. Lost a lot of good men in the process. Kewl! Uh bonus? Me neither. Hey! Broflovski's a good cop! Awwwwrrr-auugh. We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista. Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?! Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired. Okay. Butters? Are you still trying to give a semen sample? Well, keep tryin', Butters. A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods? Uh oh... Bang bang bang... Kenny, it doesn't go "Pakew! Pakew!", it goes "BANG BANG BANG!!" Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five. On your American Express. You did? Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five? Man, Indians have it good, huh? All right, let's go! I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?! Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude. Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians! That's right! Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go! No? We can't give Kyle AIDS? Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now. Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts! You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies! What? Tell us? Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever! What a dork! Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys. That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us. Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you! Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay! GOD I HATE CRAIG!! That son of a... djah!! You're straight like a freeway! You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!! ...So? I'm half bisexual! I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi. Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp. Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that- Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second? Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle. We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle. Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy. He's not our friend. Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now. That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade. Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! God dammit! Heheheheheh heheheheheh. Inspiration. Wait a minute, that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see? Our band should play Christian rock! Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap! It worked for Creed! You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius! Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do! Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle! Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. I told you, Token. Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives. We are going to start... a Christian rock band. Wait! Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- Still want to leave, Token? Thank you. All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them. See? All we have to do is cross out words like "baby" and "Darling" and replace them with Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat. Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line. Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass. Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line!  All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. Almost there, you guys. Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover. The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover. I'm going to kill you one day, Token. Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool! Token, look away to the right. More. More! So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it! Our first album cover. Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go. Oh hey guys. How's it going? I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band, Faith + 1, is about to go platinum. That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya! Hahahaha ha ha! It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album. I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually.. I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ. Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off. Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! Who are you? Yeah, you guys are real hardcore. Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage. Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better. Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song. Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent. Yes, we sure do. Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ?? Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this?? I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now. Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone. Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday. I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face! The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned! Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly. Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense. We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole. There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone! Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you! Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on. Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album? You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?! GOD DAMMIT!! Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums! OH, FUCK JESUS!! Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole! Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring. Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly. With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey! I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body. Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again. Calm down! We cannot understand you! Old people! Oh God, they're coming! They're not gonna stop until we're all dead! Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong? My God, he's right. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death. Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys. Except for you, Kyle. I believe that's us... thank God. More old people! Old people gone mad! So our only solution is to cut off their life force. No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply. Here. Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do. Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week. I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight. We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people. At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town. Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's officeand steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. Yeah! Aw yeah! Well, right, or we could always do that. Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome. Who's joking? You have AIDS? Wow! Casa Bonita?! Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and all kinds of stuff! This Saturday! Awesome! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere. Casa Bonita! You... your Mom said you could take three friends. Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny? Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?! I have never been a dick to you. Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew? Okay, except maybe for that one time. Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day! Kiss my balls, asshole!!! Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle. I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it. Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys! Oh, awesome!! Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave! Wow, cliff divers! More sopapillas, please! No! Noooo! Casa Bonita! Noooo! AAAAH!! Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle! Hi Kyle. What isn't it? ...I don't understand the difference. Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up! Dude, uh I need your help on something. Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how "do" you act nice to people? Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people? Like what? Who's there? Take that, Jimmy! And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again! Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?! Oh, Kyle. Hey. Uh... He-hey Kyle! Knock knock. Knock knock, Kyle! Hey Kyle. Well what? I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go. So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool. I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore. Good. Sweet, whatever. Bingo! Butters, can you keep a secret? For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible. A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth. Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think. Do you see anything? Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust. Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth. I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations. 10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus. According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours. No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter! Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks. No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others. I'm not sure of anything anymore. Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth. Well, you know, with your wiener. Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present. Hope you have a good one. See you later. Yes? Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything? Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure. Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters. Well, let's get going, shall we? Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters... Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the... In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then. Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?! Butters! Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible! The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time... There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh... We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild. I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday. G-goodbye! All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight. Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. What what what? UUuuugh!! Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way! The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals! They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive. We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box! There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins. Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top. Good. Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town. All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble. We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter. Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here. Oh my God! It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! We've got to fight them off! Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope! Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!! Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh! Die! The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me, which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well. We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you! Look! There's an old refrigerator! Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you! Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change. No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter. I love you too, man. I just You look so delicious! Must eat your brains!
