This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball.
Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa! [No response. Cartman can't get a rise out of Kyle] Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time.
Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball!
You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.
He's a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin.
Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies.
[walks in and begins to rap the walls with his fist] Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies. [raps on the wall and the pitch changes] Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?
Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am. [she climbs up until her eyes are level with his] See that? Hippies. [five hippies are sitting in a clearing in the attic, smoking and laughing.]
These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard.
Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard. [eight hippies are seen seated around a small campfire drumming away. Logs are scattered around them]
Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.
[goes back to rapping the walls, then stops] Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas. [raps again. The wall begins to crack and he steps aside. A hippie breaks through and falls to the floor. Cartman says under his breath] God dammit! [pulls out a fire extinguisher from his backpack]
God damn hippie! [opens fire. Foam spews out from the extinguisher]
Get out of here!
Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!
The college know-it-all hippies.
[opens the door real quick and tosses another hippie down the stairs] All right, in you go.
Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! [the throng backs down]
What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why!
Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it.
And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints [tosses a bunch of joints down to the hippies], and a guitar! [tosses that down as well and shuts the door. He then locks it and sets a large beam across the door, then walks away. The hippies are left there, coughing. One of them takes the guitar and sings]
Please, I have to talk to you all right now!
Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!
I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it. [some surprise is seen among the council members] For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town. [puts a laptop on the table and turns it on] At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence. [pulls a projector towards the laptop] Then I saw this... [connects the projector to the laptop, and the projector turns on. Everyone then looks at the screen. Cartman goes to it and points a few things out] Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... hippie music festival.
It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that lasts for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. [the adults don't get it, Cartman sighs heavily]
I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!
It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. '
What are you doing?! [Johnson hauls him away] You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug! [he disappears from view, but peeks in one last time] The town is in serious danger! [Johnson returns to close the door]
I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to my basement!
[stops and thinks through what he just heard, then turns around] Oh Jesus, not you guys? [approaches Stan and checks him out] What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!
Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'd expect the same from you. [the hippie that wore the guitar over his shoulder approaches the boys]
Everybody get in a single-file line!
Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted.
What?
You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!
No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! [Barbrady puts him in the passenger seat, then gets into the driver's seat and peels away]
What did I do?!
They're not people, they're HIPPIES!
[walks to his cell door] Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!
[steps back, stunned] You... You what?
They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!
You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN! [Cartman snaps]
[quickly composes himself] How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippies!
[gets off his bed] Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.
[angered] Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.
[a bit resentful] Forget it. [turns his back on them and walks back to his bed]
It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!
[turns away again] Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.
I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.
Yes. [turns around] Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!
All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and be super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?! [The adults just look back at him]
All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.
In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. Our only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here. [points to the stage] If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system. [shows off a CD-R of Slayer music] Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all.
We drill. [flips the page and a blueprint appears.] I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.
Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.
All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong. [he looks around, panning by Chef once] Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see... [his gaze passes Chef again] Oh, I know. How about- [his gaze falls upon Chef and stays there]
There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we- [his face is distorted. Moments later he sneezes and his face is normal again.] got.
I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog. [his plush toy sits on a chair] Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. [smiles, wipes a tear from his eye, and joins the rest of the crew into the hippie digger. They turn to wave at the townsfolk, who cheer and wave back. Some people take pictures]
Primary engine running?
Navigation systems?
Let's punch this baby. [the digger rolls off its platform] We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on. [the digger lunges into the crowd, tossing hippies left and right, maybe killing a few in the process. Inside, the crew is jostled about] Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?
Switching to secondary fuel line. [warning lights begin to flash and warning sounds are heard] What's that?
Come on, come on!
No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there!
...All right, fine Chef, go!
Hit the PA system NOW! [the crew goes over to it] Put me in the main line! [Randy turns and shoves an unconscious man at the controls off and gathers some cords]
You're the scientist, jackass!
Put them in my laptop! [Randy connects one of the cords to the laptop. Cartman selects a song from the Slayer CD he put in the CD-ROM drive: "Raining Blood" He clicks "Play" and the song blasts forth from the stage speakers. The crowd listens for a while, then begins to disperse.]
Hold it right there, Kyle! [Cartman has a small dagger in its sheath. He pulls it out]
Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you, Kyle.
Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee! [offers the remote control] Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while. [Kyle rises and takes a few steps, but Cartman withdraws the offer] Oh, sorry! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!
Of course he sings. He's black.
Two hundred dollars.
You wanna know what it is, guys?
That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.
[leaves the table] Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.
So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!
We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. [strokes his chin]
Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.
Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.
[motioning them away] Okay, go go, here he comes. [they leave, and he walks into Token's field of view talking into his cell phone] Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested. [stops just before they collide] Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!
[puts his phone away] Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.
Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.
This will only take a second.
Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm? [they look at the fountains for a few moments, then Cartman turns Token around] Come on over this way, Token. [the other boys come to greet Token] Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client.
Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, "Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?" Right?
[...and reappear on either side of him] Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of. [his phone rings] Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token. [takes the "call"] Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln? [Token just looks on. Kyle is stunned that Cartman would mention Lincoln, then gets cross about it] Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.
I'll I'll call you back, Abe. [hangs up. Kyle pulls him behind the partition]
I'm making it look like important people call us.
[thinks for a moment] ...well Token doesn't know that.
How?!
Jew! [Stan comes around the corner]
Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that. [goes to his desk and clears his throat. Stan and Kyle flank him again] Ah, now, where were we?
Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? [slides the contract towards Token, and Token signs it]
From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.
We represent Token. [hands the man a business card] Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.
Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is...
Sweet!
You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.
Token, you signed with us!
What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!
...Oooo...
...Goddamnit! [throws down the $20 bill]
This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on! [Tuong Li Kim comes into view, climbing down the stairs]
You've ...already done all the work?
We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us. [Wing continues singing]
Excuse us!
Dude, how long is the wait?
Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone. [clears his throat and whips out his phone] Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.
Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken.
Stupid assholes! [they pass an agent talking on a cell phone]
Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?
Come on, Wing!
She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. [Fernanda delivers more blows until Wing is knocked out and falls to the side]
Gay.
Your gift of hope is a great deduction. [no one stops to donate. Stallone and his producers come out and approach the boys]
Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer. [Stallone mumbles some more]
Four thousand dollars? [Stallone mumbles some more and hands his producer a card]
That's four hundred for us! We did it! [tosses his cup away]
Who let the dogs out?
Who let the dogs out?
Who let-?
Naw, sh-she was with you!
[move forward] Wing? Wing?
Wing? Here, Wing!
Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.
Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!
Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls.
Oh my God, you guys. Look! [they face a two-story-tall fountain with a curving stairway on each side] They do have an amazing fountain. [four guards appear and run down one of the staircases, getting into positions]
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! [leaves the counter]
Do you wanna play rough?! Okay! [comes out from behind the wall] Take this! [begins firing away. He has no control over the gun, so it fires everywhere. One of the guards is struck down, another one quickly goes up the stairs again]
Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it!
Aw aw guys, come on!
Token, you're... waiting tables?
Aw man, that's too bad, Token. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop! ["make it simple, to last your whole life long." Token walks off ]
Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go! [moves to the foot of the bed] MOM, GET UP!
[goes to the other side of the bed and draws close to her face] Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one! [turns on her light] Come on! [goes back to the door]
Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go!
I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry! [they pull up to the curb and stop. Cartman gets out of the car] WHAT THE HELL?!
Kenny, when did you get here?
Friday?! Aw, Jesus! [he switches tactics] I'll just... sort of get in here- in here. [gets in line between Kenny and the Goth Kids]
Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line.
Oh, Goddammit! [moves to the back of the line] They'd better not sell out!
YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE! [Cartman folds his arms]
JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!!!
(looking bored) Fags!
[suddenly excited and cocky] Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?
Who cares? Kenny's dead! [rushes up to the lawyer's desk] When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?
[salivating] Yes!
Well... well then he's NOT alive.
That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look. [climbs onto Kenny's bed and holds out a $1 bill] Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?
Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube.
Um, it was um, this one time...
Stupid? PSP is stupid?! [steps forth] Did you all hear that? [steps back to his little group] Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!
Did so!
Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew! [moves towards the door] I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court! [runs out]
You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right.
I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF.
That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look. [brings forth a necklace with the left half of a BFF heart medallion] Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is.
[comes in with the Chief Justice] He's right in here.
That's right. Respect our authoritah.
I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato!
You say Kenny, but I say tomato! [both sides yell at each other]
What?
[runs to the mound] We're done! No more baseball!
All right, we did it! [the rest of the team shows up and celebrates]
Post-season?
Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals!
All right, hit one out of the park!
[sends the ball back to Stan] Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it.
All right! [throws it back to Stan]
Ball. Balll. [Stan pitches right down the middle]
That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery!
What?!
[throws his bat down and walks] Aw Goddamnit! [as Cartman walks to first, anotherr SP runner walks home]
How the hell was that a strike?! [starts kicking dirt on the umpire] Goddamnit, he's going to first!
What happens if we win the State Championship game?
Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.
Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass.
I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!
[happily] We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!
Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!
She's got Colonel!
Oh boy!
Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy?
Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.
[turns around] Well, I saved you all the chicken part. [quiet burp]
[puts on his jacket] Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow. [he leaves the kitchen. The boys are puzzled as to what to do about it. Burying his head in his arms, Kenny sobs]
[arriving] Hey fags, what's going on? [no one says a word] Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die. [silence]
Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one. [Stan fishes around for some money in his pockets, walks over a bit, and gives it to Kyle] Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?
Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle? [neither of them says a thing] Eh. K-Kenny, you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off? [chuckles. Kenny scratches his right side a bit] Kenny? Kenny?? [the bus pulls up and opens the door. The boys head inside. Stan enters first] Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric! [Kenny enters next] Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents? [Kyle enters last] Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here! [Seeing no reaction, Cartman is stunned. The door closes and the bus pulls away] Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were... [close-up] dead. [dramatic music] No. No, I can't be dead. [runs off] I can't be dead!!
No! No!!
Oh my God, this can't be happening! [he then hears his mother wailing softly, then louder] Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true! [he gets closer to her window. Inside his mother's room, on her bed, the black plumber is pounding Liane from behind, but the bed's noise does not reach Cartman's ears. Cartman turns, wailing.] Oh, it's not fair! [falls to his knees and cries out] Why??? Why??? [cries some more. Liane cries out some more as well]
[arriving] Guys! Guys? [the two teams are seen: On screen left are Jimmy, Token, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. On screen right are Timmy, Craig, Clyde, Kevin, and the blond boy. The teams toss the football at each other] Can anybody hear me? You guys?? [approaches Token] Token, Token, I'm here! [leaves] Hello! Hello! Hello! [approaches Clyde] Clyde, can't you feel me? [moves him around, but no reaction from Clyde] Feel me, Clyde! [moves on to Jimmy] Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric! [blows on Jimmy] Jimmy! [puff] Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me! [turns away] They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead. [begins to tear up] Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.
[walking by, lamenting his fate] What did I do to deserve this?! [Butters pays attention] How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!
...What did you say?
Butters... [runs back to Butters] Butters! You can see me??
Oh my God, and you can hear me??
Because, Butters, I'm... dead. [a few moments of silence]
Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!
I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.
I don't know, but you're the only one who can.
Butters! [tries to open the door, then pounds on it furiously] Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!
Butters...
Butters, you have to help me!
All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. [pulls out a chain, rattles it, and utters ghostly sounds]
[suddenly on the bed] Butters.
Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!
Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven.
What do you mean?
I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!
Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.
This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life! [brings out the chain, rattles it, and makes ghostly noises with his voice]
[emotional] Tell her, tell her that I love her.
[emotional] Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!
[emotional] It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!
Just the good times.
I can't! Don't you understand?!
God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!
[whips out a notepad] All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black. [turns around and walk off]
Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's everyone, I guess. [turns around] All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.
[puts away the notepad in his inside jacket pocket.] Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now.
Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.
[backs up and waves his hands in front of him as if in a haze] G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! [Cartman steps back a bit more, then stops, then is annoyed]
Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?
What else do I have to do?!
Atone?
[thinks] Not really...
Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it.
I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.
Really?
I know how.
Well, there's everything, Butters. [stands up and walks off a bit] I've made everything right.
Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave. [waves his hands around again as if in a haze] Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye... [his back hits the wall under the window, and he looks at his hands] Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!
I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?! [grabs Butters' bat and begins destroying his room with it. First to go is the lamp on top of the foot locker, then something else, then a picture of Butters sitting on a tree stump, then the television, then the television stand, ] Do you think this is funny,..?
Butters.
Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here.
I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look! [shows Butters an ad for a psychic] Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!
She's gonna close soon! Come on! [pulls Butters out of bed and away]
I told you, Butters. [a breaking news item comes on]
Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!
All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages.
Don't worry. I have a plan. [movers towards an entrance]
They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead. [Cartman moves towards the front door. The detective notices]
Yes, it's working! [hops on a chair, picks up a book, waves it around, and flips the pages in the lead convict's face]
Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.
My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends.
We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.
[backs up again, waving his hands before him] Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach him from his right side, Clyde, Token and Jimmy approach him from his left]
[pissed off] You sonofabitch Butters!
You told me I was a ghost!
How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to [points his finger at Butters] GET YOU BACK! [runs off. Butters just looks at him, baffled. His parents arrive with the doctor]
Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?!
No room at the inn, Virgin Mary. [Jimmy heads back to the sinks and throws water on his face, then throws water on his pants' crotch]
Up yours, Butters.
Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?
Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food.
Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times.
I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener.
Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.
[hiding in some bushes nearby] Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks.
[at a nearby booth] Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, "Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."
[Roma sets some plates of food on his table] All right, when she stops yappin' again, say "Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right."
All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with "Wow, how insightful."
Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.
Aaagh!
[starts off with his back to the audience, then turns around] D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say "That's the bad guy!" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!
Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around.
You know how?
Well here. [reaches down to grab something] Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.
Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility.
[puts on sunglasses as the engine purrs to life] Awesome.
We're not moving.
Maybe you have the parking brake on.
Waaait! Waitwaitwaaait!
Stan... beaver dam! [the boat approaches the dam quuickly] Very large beaver dam, Stan!! [the boat runs aground on the dam and the boys quickly jump out. The boat begins to smoke as the boys swim to the nearest shore. Stan, being lighter and faster, reaches shore first, then turns to wait for Cartman. The boat blows up and Stan shields his eyes. Cartman reaches the shore and walks up to Stan]
[turns around and sees] Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble!
I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.
Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail! [hustles up the beach]
[turns to look at Stan] Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here! [Cartman turns back and continues up the beach. Stan turns and follows Cartman up]
Yeah.
Shyeah, that was pretty funny.
Hehey, no no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault!
Well they should've gotten out of there!
We did!
Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!
[smiling proudly] Hngh, totally.
[throws down his cap] Aw crap!
[arrives] Hey Stan. [studies Stan and Kyle's faces] Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?!
Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?!
Why?
[turns around and heads towards Stan] Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle! [Kyle turns and looks at him] "Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility."
Help! Help! [a large drum falls from the ceiling in front of Kyle]
Not so fast, Kyle.
Hand over the gold!
You know what I'm talkng about!
All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!
[pulls out a 9 mm handgun, hopefully fake.] I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!
Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle!
I want... your Jew gold! [Kyle has run out of things to say and stands there. Cartman glowers at him, ready to fire the gun if he moves]
[moves the bag around for heaviness] Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!! [Kyle, angered at this delaying tactic, pulls out another small bag from under his coat and walks over to Cartman. Cartman laughs evilly as Kyle approaches. Kyle smiles an evil smile back and tosses the second bag over his shoulder and into the fire below. Cartman rushes over to grab it, but doesn't get there in time Kyle rushes up the stairs at the other end of the landing] No! Noooooo! [watches the fire]
Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God! [runs up to the platform and jumps on. The helicopter flies off]
...Aw man.
[steps forward] Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe.
[closes the door and comes downstairs] Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge.
What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future.
Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true. [pulls TV from the back] I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera [shows the camera]. I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children.
Video playback initialized. [presses play on the remote control and the screen shows the girls playing]
Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image! [presses the pause button] Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.
[comes to Clyde and Kevin's table] How is the incubation shield coming Clyde?
Good man.[goes over to the computer Kyle, Stan, and Token are working on] Any luck here?
Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it. [moves to the middle of the tent] All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here.
Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?
Heidi Turner [turns on a projector on which is shown her picture] is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it.
No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.
No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that!
Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.
[behind Butters] Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet. [Clyde, Stan, and Craig dress the pig while Cartman makes a Butter mask for it]
Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters. [the pig is done, Butters steps down, and the pig is shoved into place]
Okay. One! Two! [Craig, Clyde, and Stan push the dressed pig]
Nice.
[whispers to Stan]Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it. [clears his throat]
[pretends like he's yawning]Dude, they totally think he's a girl. [coughs]
[pretends like he's yawning]Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker. [coughs] This is going swimmingly. [coughs]
Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it.
Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out. [Kyle glares at him]
God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.
That son of a bitch!
Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.
Working on what?! Your dance moves?!
Just do what you were sent to do, dickface! [hangs up]
Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go! [Clyde runs up, gets it, and runs off]
Haahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! [turns around and runs as the other boys run away]
Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future. [handles the future-telling device with black gloves]
No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions.
Because I do, Clyde.
I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?
Will you all shut up so I can do this!?
Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!?
Think of the power!
Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future.
Damn, Ken.
I broke the egg.
I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.
...No.
No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us.
Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!
[thinks about what just happened] Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before.
...Why are you doing this?
What do you want from me?
...No.
[choking] Yes teacher.
[walks up to the front of the class and turns around, looking at his paper] Thank you, Mrs. Garrison. [reads] My speech is entitled "Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles." [Stan and Kyle glance at each other] We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids. [cues up his pics. A red-headed boy appears] Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles. [next picture is of a girl licking her triple-scoop ice-cream cone] Aw, nasty! Yuck! [returns to his paper] This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.
Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured. [another redheaded girls pops up] Ah sick! [another redhead] Gross! [another redhead] Yeck! [returns to his paper] Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike... [a picture of a vampire with a full moon and bats behind him pops up] vampires.
I was getting to that, if you will let me. [returns to his paper] Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called "daywalkers." [cues up a picture of Kyle, with "daywalkers" written underneath]
Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions...
Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth! [Kyle grits his teeth and growls, trying to contain himself] Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse, [next picture: a boy with a few missing front teeth] and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one, [the last pic is that of Carrot Top] think again. [the bell rings and the kids file out of the classroom.]
Informative if you want to die. [hops off his seat and joins Butters and Kyle] Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all. [moves towards the door] Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA! [points at Clyde, who jumps back.]
-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille
I'M GINGER!
Help me! Hellp mee!
And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!
So I'm gonna stay like this forever?
Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like! [crosses his arms] Right, Mom?! [a bit shocked when she doesn't answer right away] Mom?!
Hey dudes, what's goin' on? [coughs to clear his throat] How is everything with you guys?
Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.
Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.
Yes, Kyle. [coughs] The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.
What do you mean, Kyle?
[thinks] Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle. [the school bus pulls up and opens its doors. The kids climb in and find seats]
That's fine, just get it out of the way...
[Walks up to an empty space between Clyde and Token] Hey Clyde, Token. Sup, Jim? [begins to eat]
I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?
Huh?
But... it's me.
Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. [the camera looks around at the other kids at the table, who remain silent]
I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!
Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us "genetically inferior." The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!
...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like... [he can't think of any] Like uh... [looks up in thought, then softly] Liiike...
Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...
Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!
Red Power! [Stan stops the game and the boys look at the source of commotion. Cartman leads the gingers across the playground]
Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!
[resumes the march] Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
Better red than dead!
Better red than dead!
That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!
The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!
There she is! Get her! [the gingers rush her and start ganging up on her] Die, you stupid bitch!
[comes in pumped up like a televangelist to his own theme music] Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'? [the redhead cheer] Can I get a Red Power?
Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!
Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! [all the redheads cheer wildly]
We're fine, thanks.
We're fine!
You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!! [Gary closes the door] My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them!
Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!
My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! [the gingers stomp and cheer]
What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled! [more stomping and cheering]
No, we're fine! Thank you!
Yes! We're good!
You're welcome, now leave us alone!! [Gary leaves and closes the door] Now! Let the extermination begin! [more stomping and cheering] We will start... with the daywalker!
Go on then! Say your last words!
Okay fine, let him speak! [the redheads let Kyle go, and Kyle falls on his face] Then we kill every non-ginger here! [Kyle gets up, walks over to Cartman, and whispers in his ear. Cartman's anger vanishes, then surprise appears] You... you what? [Kyle repeats himself. Cartman looks around a bit fearfully, then touches his face all over and grits his teeth]
[now hesitant] Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something. [backpedals] We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us. [throws away his staff] What have we become?
D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together.
Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like.
See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. [the gingers look at him, stunned]
... Huh?
Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated.
Cartman:
That's it! You've got it!
Live together!
The same, you and I!
Yes, but I'm not going to die. [steps forth] That's why we gotta get along, people!
Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!
HA! Saving money, duhhh! [turns left and walks. The others follow. Kenny moves the card in his left hand to his right hand]
Hey, I know! Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex.
Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars.
Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag. [he, Kenny and Kyle walk off]
Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you. [leaves]
I'm all wet! Sweet!
Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!!
Yes! Yeehehehes! [Jambu returns with Kelly on his nose as if she were a hood ornament]
I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.
Why?
Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares?
Killer. [the boys turn and leave]
Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. [turns to catch up with Stan and Kenny. Kyle walks around the tank]
[slapping the water as a stingray approaches] Heh! Come on, stingray! [it speeds away. Another one approaches] Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me! [it speeds away as well] Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!
Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man.
Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale.
You live on the moon?
Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?
Yeah, we just have to keep him wet.
He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.
Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch.
We have to hurry!
Uh oh.
Oh crap! There's more of them! [police cruisers pour in and officers pour out of them]
Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now. [Stan looks at the sky and steps forward. The other boys join him. Before them, up in the sky, is the full moon, bright and nicely detailed]
Ichi banzai
Ichi banzai! Kya!
I'm doing some sweet bun-sow moves. [an aside] I'm a little better than everyone else here.
Nah-uh, I don't raku disciprine!
Yeah, let's go.
Sure, whatever dude.
[turns around] No, dude, it's the police. [the sirens are heard]
Dude, what the hell is he doing?
You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine!
Man, that was such a bummer.
Why?
All right, Stan. Sure. [the school bell rings and Mrs. Garrison enters with her books, setting them on her desk]
