You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. [the others look up at him]
Forever.
Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. [Chef opens a pamphlet about the club]
Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. [Kyle draws close and hugs him]
[irritable] I'll get it. [rises and walks over. He opens the door...]
He's back!
But are you back for good?
Right. Uh, see ya.
[stops. The others stop too. Stan looks up] Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.
[turns left and cross the street. The others follow] Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.
What??
Dude, what are you saying??
...WHAT??
No he's not.
No he's not.
Now, we need some testimony in order to arrest Chef, [whips out generic plush doll with no features on it] so I'm gonna use this doll to ask you kids a few questions. Did Chef ever touch any of you... here? [points to the genital area]
NO!
No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!
Well look, he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.
NO!!
[unnaffected] No! [Mr. Connolly tries harder, even stepping forward...]
Knew what?
You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.
Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.
No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.
Having sex with women.
This isn't working.
Come on guys, we might as well go. [the boys prepare to leave. The obese stripper can move, though, and Chef is interested. He drops the blonde off and approaches the stage]
Chef, we're leaving.
He's remembering.
Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!
Oh Jesus, here we go.
We don't wanna hear it.
Immortal?
Yeah, it's way, way more retarded.
We're not leaving without Chef.
[to one of the guards] No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!
[rushes up to Chef] Come on, Chef!
We made it!
Chef, come on!
[softly] Chef, we love you.
NO! [Chef struggles to get up, but can't move. A mountain lion leaps down into view]
Oh my God...They killed Chef!
Come on, let's go.
Smug Alert!
Oh hey Kyle.
Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
Yeah? [the door opens and Butters enters]
Going away party? What do you mean?
[jumps off his chair and looks at Butters] Moving away?? Kyle can't move away!
Where's the going-away party?
[enters the house and the other boys move a bit] Kyle? Kyle!
What?!
Kyle! Du-what is going on?!
Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend.
Well... Maybe they'll change.
Nooo!
I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!
Come on, people. Come on, people now. [Cartman and Butters enter]
I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!
You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
Come on, people. Come on, people now.

as he sings, the following takes place: FM 1 98.7 shows up, Randy notices his son singing, Jimbo notices his nephew singing, a stranger slumps a little in his car, Principal Victoria notices one of her students singing, other people stop to listen

as he sings, the following takes place: Randy joins the rush of customers checking out hybrids at the dealership, Jimbo drives off in his new red hybrid and pulls up next to the Stotches, who are driving their new hybrid as well. They give each other thumbs up and gloat a bit. Another driver pulls up alongside Randy and gives him a thumbs up. Randy returns the gesture. More people check out the dealership. Mrs.Tucker(Craig's mother) pulls up alongside Jimbo
Come on, everybody be people now
[steps up and holds his trophy] Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. [steps down and walks off the stage. The crowd cheers]
Yeah.
Ow!
What?!
Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.
Smug?
No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!
Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly.
What is that?
George Clooney's acceptance speech?
What about San Francisco?
[stops and turns to face the crowd] I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
No...
What?
Kyle!
Dude, what happened?? [grins]
[gives Kyle a brief hug] Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.
Cartoon Wars Part I
[awakens and looks around as the lights come on] What?? What??
Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!
Dad? [Randy is cutting duct tape into several equal-length strips] Dad, what the hell is going on?! [Randy stands up and faces the boys. Behind him, Mr. Mackey and a man in a raincoat set up a TV]
Sso?
Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??
They censored the image of Mohammad? How?
Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy.
What? What's the big deal?
Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!
The hell's going on now?!
Does this mean we don't have school all week?
Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.
To Los Angeles?
Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.
Yeah.
Dad, this is stupid.
Cartoon Wars Part II
A Million Little Fibers
This is a really good idea...
A publisher's office, day. The publisher reviews the first draft Towelie brings in
ManBearPig
Who?
[open under the net] Pass it to me, Cartman?
Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!
Oh, hey Dad.
Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.
He could be half bear, half manpig.
But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.
Hello?
[shuts his eyes and covers them with his left hand] Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore.
I know.
Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.
No, no, it's not that.
Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.
Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.
...Yes, I'm serial.
Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. [the door opens and Al Gore greats the boys]
Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.
NO.
Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.
Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.
Oh no!
Help!
Help!
[faces Cartman] Me??
Maybe there's another way out of here.
[returning] There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. [Cartman arrives]
Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?
Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.
Dude, he's really sick. [Cartman has moved on to swallowing necklaces and loose gemstones]
[wakes up and rubs his eyes] Huh? What? Have they come for us?
Oh my God. [runs up to Cartman] Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?
How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.
Goddamnit, he's soo heavy!
Cartman?
[exhausted] I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!
Kenny! Here, take my hand! [Kenny does so and makes it to safety. A change of POV shows Kyle hauling Cartman] Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!
Kyle! No!
Agh.
Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!
Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.
Tsst
[takes his turn] You can't stay here.
Dude, have you lost more weight?
Dude, we're not killing your mom.
Where am I supposed to get a gun?
I'm not shooting anybody.
Make Love, Not Warcraft
[the blue knight, with sword and shield] Dude! We've been waiting forever!
H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something.
What?!
[swivels around to face his dad] I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.
All right, sorry guys. So where to now?
[stops and motions] Oh crap! It's that guy again! [a player approaches them and begins to dance. The character is wearing a helmet, boots, elbow-length gloves, and tight shorts. No shirt, no other armor]
This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.
Oh my God, he killed Kenny!
[head resting on left hand] Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.
Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!
Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway!
Dude, we have to try.
Come on, let's do this!
Look! There he is!
Dad??
Dad, get off our teamspeak line!
[the ganker kills him. He throws off his headset again] That's it, screw this game!
Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.
We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' in
The Blizzard boardroom. Executives are monitoring the gameplay.
Kyle's room, 6:30 a.m. He rises from bed, which means he went to bed at 3:30 a.m. He's gotten as big and pimply as Stan. He hops out of bed, heads for his father's den and then to the computer and logs into the game to slaughter more boars.
I'm in.
+15 agility.
'K.
That's übercool.
Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.
Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us.
Kyle! [Kyle leaves his desk grabbing onto his right hand, then flexes his right wrist around. Stan leaves his desk and approaches him] Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?
Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad! [Cartman walks over]
Hurry dude!
Kyle, you have to keep playing.
We can't do this without you now! Come on! [he and Cartman help Kyle back to his computer]
You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!
Dude, I'm almost dead.
[his character leaves the battle] I've gotta heal. [his character turns to see the battle]
Dad? Not now!
Dad, how did you get that?!
Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...
I got it! [the ganker stabs Randy and Randy goes down]
Dad!
Dad, no! [turns around to face the ganker] You killed my father. [walks up to the ganker and strikes him with one blow of the sword. The ganker's defenses start to crack.]
Dad? Dad?
I know you do, Dad.
We did it!
Yeah.
I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?
Got it.

A wall toilet for peeing in.
Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
Yeah, at least one-fourth.
[appears suddenly in the living room] Kyle!
Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys [looks around] are coming to my house and questioning me about you??
Well why did you have to involve me??
All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.
Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you. [moves off, then stops and turns around] There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?
[mulls it over] That's all I needed. [turns around and heads for the back door. Kyle follows.]
Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.
Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?
JESUS CHRIST!!
He was right. You DID cause 9/11.
Why?!
[off on a different page] Is the whole government in on this?
[seeing their chance] Kyle! Run! [the boys take off with the Secret Service in hot pursuit]
All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude. [next scene is another city, somewhere] We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.
Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.
Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? [Kyle stops and turns around]
What who said?
Oh God!
Who are you?
Aw Jesus...
How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!
It was all planned out!
Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!
[lowers his pistol] Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?
Yuh.
Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.
Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy
Car Salesman
Teacher
Sure dude.
Dude, what's the matter?
...Wow.
Dude, I really don't see a problem.
I got some badass guys to help me.
Think you can get away with not having a hall pass? Think again! [the video ends and the hallway looks normal again] How was that, Butters?
Butters
Hell on Earth 2006
Go ahead, Kyle, do it.
[rushes into the living room with the other boys] Dad! Dad!
If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??
Smalls
It does work!!
We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls.
Go God Go
It's still three weeks.
Dude you don't look so good, Cartman.
Do what?
Dude, no way.
Well there could still be a god.
Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?
I wasn't talking about spaghetti. [Mrs. Garrison picks him up, desk and all, and carries him to the front of the class.]
Go God Go XII
Stanley's Cup
I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.
[insistent] My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. [behind him, outside the window, a tow truck pulls up]
Yeah. Why?
[turns around] What?? [walks to the door and looks out its window, then leaves the office while the driver locks the bike in place]
Hey, hey! What are you doing?!
Yes!
No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!
[climbs up the door towards the driver] No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike! [the truck moves forward and Stan hops off. He moves towards the bike.] Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! [catches up to the bike and grabs one of the pedals, but that just jerks him up and down a few times as the wheel on the ground moves the pedals. Stan hits the ground several times, getting bruised until he finally lets go of the pedal and rests on the street. He looks on helplessly as the truck keeps moving and his bike disappears in the distance]
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-
I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?
[several seconds later] Look, I really need my bike.
What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!
...Yeah?
[apprehensive] Me?
Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here. [the kids move towards him, tumbling. Stan decides to go in and meet them] We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.
My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-
All right, fine, go ahead.
S- hold it a while, okay?
When you shoot the puck to another player.
All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.
Why not?!
What, you got asthma or something?
[off guard] What?
Ah, it's okay. Don't cry.
[feeling overwhelmed] Oh Jesus, can we just practice?
NO! [a rival team and its coach walk up to Park County]
[steps forward to reply] Hey. [Coach Gavin withdraws his hand]
Jesus Christ. [his parents walk up to him]
I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.
I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.
I'm not playing, I'm coaching.
[tense] What are you talking about?
[relaxes] I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.
[heads upstairs] I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed. [Randy moves towards him a bit, but Stan's door closes, and Randy turns to Sharon]
[blows his whistle] All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice.
Oh
Ohhh.
... I don't know.
No, I think you oughta.
[enters the room] Oh uh, hey Nelson.
Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?
Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?
Ogh.
Goddammit, dude, I don't know.
No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?
Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? [gives him a thumbs up and walks away]
No- dude, I told you I can't do that.
Okay. [pause. He steps out of the room and closes the door. Behind the door is the judge, waiting. He has his record player with him. He starts playing it...]
[walks up to Gavin] Coach, can I talk to you for a second?
[takes him aside] Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?
All right, guys, listen. [turns around] I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. [the players look at each other]
Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.
Let's go, Park! Come on!
Get near the puck! [Park County players fall. No one is getting near the puck. No. 15, the goalie, continues picking his nose. Fast forward to the end of the third period. An Adams County player is struggling to keep his bladder in check. One second left in the game]
Tie? Well, what does that mean?
Hello?
How are you feeling?
Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?
Oh boy.
But what can I do?
Well, ah, I mean...
Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em.
Well, sure we can.
Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?
They're not gonna kill us.
[thinks a bit] Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end.
Hey that's right. We need a ringer. [smiles]
It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. [Ike is wearing #2]
Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.
[at an entrance with his team] All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?! [all the players are with him in their own ways.] All right, let's go win!
Huh?
Sso then we win?
Hey. Hey, you can't do this. [the Avs come up behind Park County] We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!
But it isn't supposed to end like this!
[turns around and face the Avs] Play the Red Wings?
Jesus Christ! [another Red Wing takes the puck to the goal, but kicks another Park County player into the plastic off to the side] Stop! Stop this!
Hey, can they do that??
With Apologies to Jesse Jackson
[covers his eyes] Oooo. [Sharon and Shelly are stunned]
Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!
No he's not. [looks at Kyle] Is he?
I just need to explain things. [walks up to Token, who's finished with the locker and holds only a binder in his right hand] Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-
Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?
Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.
Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.
Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.
Well, yeah.
Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!
[softly] He told my dad he was...
Token! Hey, wait up. [Token turns around] I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that "little person" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word.
God dammit!
Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!
I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
What the hell do you want from me?! [Butters appears across the street, rather out of breath. Upon seeing them, he runs over]
Then stop being mad!
What was his point?
Dude, I don't get it.
[comes to a certain realization] Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.
Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it! [smiles, then walks up to Token] Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.
[smiles] Yeah. I totally don't get it.
Cartman Sucks
Come on, let's go. [leads Kyle and Kenny out the door.]
What'cha do to Butters this time?
Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?
You are now.
You can't!
Because it's really, really funny.
That isn't funny.
Aw man, I've got H O R S now. [steps aside as Kenny receives the ball.]
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
Director
Lice Capades
[looks to Kyle] What do you think happens if you do have it?
Somebody in this class?
You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
Yeah... Or you. [they check out each other]
Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice. [walks up to him] Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!
You had head lice?
The Snuke
Dude, we totally got let out of school.
Russian?
So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.
Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. [CIA agents enter the room quickly with their equipment]
Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!

Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?
Right, so, why do we color eggs? [Shelly makes a cross face]
Yeah, but why?
So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
You don't see the missteps in logic with that? [Randy is unfazed, while Shelly, Sharon, and Marvin look at Stan disapprovingly] Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.
[leaves his seat] I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!
All right, can you explain to me what's going on?
What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross? [no reply] It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times? [nudges him] Answer me!
I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!
No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! [hops off and walks away]
Mom? Dad? [reaches the second floor] Anybody home?
Dad! You've gotta help me! [looks around]
Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!
They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want! [hears the front door breaking open] They're coming in! Dad, open the door! [the bathroom door opens and Randy looks out, wearing some bunny ears and a bunny snout with buck teeth.] Dad?
Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
[not impressed, but curious] Does Mom know about this?
I don't understand!
Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?
So what is the secret of Easter?
Grandpa's in it too?
Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?
You mean the old Galveston Lodge? [Randy's taken aback at Stan's memory and so thinks about what to do next. After a while, he decides to remove the bag]
Must I?
Hi Grandpa.
...Stan.
Pink Hare
Yeah.
Yeah, I wanna know already.
Where am I supposed to go?
Jesus Christ! [a monk has Randy restrained]
Oh no... [looks around, then runs off]
Help.
My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.
[enters anyway] Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me! [turns around and fires off a few questions] Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?
Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? [the professor stops and turns around]
[the butler steps aside] My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.
Just bread...
He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.
He looks like a guy.
[looks at the professor] But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?
I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
They found me!
If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us! [softly] Wait... unless... maybe there is. [hands Snowball to Kyle] Here, hold this. [walks some distance away from Kyle and prays] Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. [waits for a long time, then peeks with his right eye, then with both, but there's no sign of Jesus. He opens his eyes wide, as normal, and looks up. Kyle looks down at Snowball]
First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!
Okay, fine. [a cardinal takes Snowball from Stan, and Randy is released]
You said "hand over the bunny."
Hey, what the hell!
Jesus, you did answer my prayer! [grins]
No! No! [Stan and Randy are taken away in one direction, Kyle and Jesus in another, Benedict in still another]
Snowball! [now dressed in rabbits ears and snout like Randy. A bright light appears near one of the obelisks in the center of the piazza, and Jesus' figure appears in the light. The light fades and Jesus is all alone. The crowd oohs and aahs]
All right Jesus!
Cardinal
Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
End of Fantastic Easter Special
D-Yikes!
Uh oh, this isn't good.
[frightened] No ma'am.
Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.
Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?
We don't?
Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.
That's it, that's the whole story?
You guys, school starts in ten minutes!
[sees Clyde] Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde! [Clyde turns around] You didn't finish your essay either, right?
Again?
These guys are pretty good.
Night of the Living Homeless
[stops] Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people? [all around the basketball court homeless people loiter or sleep. There's one bum sleeping at center court. The boys walk up to him] Sir, could you move a little, please?
Well dude, what are we supposed to do?
Yeah, it's all set.
That was a sweet idea, Kyle. [smiles]
Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?
I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.
Kyle, what were you thinking?
Dude, it's our dads.
Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. [the boys turn off the TV and head outside]
Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.
Over here! [Kyle looks back. Cartman and Kenny drop down into the sewer and Kyle walks to the manhole.] Jump down! Go! [Kyle drops down, and finally, Stan]
Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. [they move forward.]
Are you the head of Homeless Studies?
We think this may be our friend's fault. [shows Kyle] He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-
There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!
What the hell happened here? [three men in camouflage appear and aim their shotguns at them]
We, just came to ask a question.
Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.
Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!
What?
[getting off the bench] But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!
Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!
No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!
All right, I'm turning around

A highway, day. The boys take the homeless westward.
Santa Monica Pier. The bus passes it going south - towards Venice Beach. The homeless follow
Venice Beach. The homeless head right in and make themselves at home
Bum
Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle.

[he doesn't say his name]
Hansen

No way!
No, never.
[feeling vindicated] That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?
Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready.
Gee, thanks a lot, Dad.
You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. [turns around and walks in]
Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.
That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?
Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.
[a bit shocked] Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?
All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.
Agh!
I take it back!
You're not number two!
What is wrong with that guy?
What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!
So Bono's newest record is a lie!
So?
He's the record.
[runs in] Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.
Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!
Dude.
That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.
Dad, are you all right?
Imaginationland
Dude...
Cool.
Where'd he go? [the leprechaun appears on a tree limb behind the boys; they turn to look at him again]
THE TRILOGY
[walks up to him] Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.
...What do you know about the leprechaun?
Who the hell are you?
Come on, guys. [the others follow him, with Butters trailing.]
Some people feel imagination isn't real, but I tell them that they're wrong,
Kyle
What is this place?
[hesitantly] Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-
Butters.
[picks up] Hello?
No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?
Yeah! How'd you know?
Why?
Dude, do you really have to do it?

What is this place?
Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.
Dude, we don't remember.
No.
Your what?
If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?
That's not very imaginative.
The Imagination song?
Operator
Kyle
Imagina-he-hey-
Kyle
Stan
Stan
[the lights dim and the portal begins to glow. The boys are confused for a moment, then face the portal with the other people present]
Dude, you did make a deal... [Kyle has run out of appeals and reluctantly follows Cartman out]
Wait, woodland critters... [begins searching his memory]
Get them out of there!
Tell them to get away now!
KYLE!! [a fading tech pushes the red button at his station as he drops to the floor. Lightning flashes into the room as a tractor beam pulls Stan into the portal. ManBearPig resists the pull, but crushes Kyle in its left hand for several seconds]
Imaginationland, Episode III
[in Kyle's head] Hello? [Kyle's eyes open and blink] Hello? Anybody? [Kyle's eyes dart around]
Hello?
Hello? Can anybody hear me?
Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.
...Oh that makes sense.
[walking down the rainbow road] I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye. [some moaning horns are heard] Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.
Kyle? What's happening?
What?! You can't let them do that!
Dude you have to stall them! [Kyle doesn't look too sure] Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!
No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.
[stands next to Butters] No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place.
So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.
The Chosen One?
[in Kyle's imagination] Kyle? Kyle, what happened?
What??
Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!
Well you have to convince them they are real!
Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?! [Kyle sighs] Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.
[approaches] Kyle!
Dude! How did you do that, Butters?
Dude.
Guitar Queer-O
Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! [a shot of the cheering CG crowd on the TV]
Stan
Yeah, that's stupid, Dad.
[turns back to the TV] Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. [the game starts up with a new song, and the boys behind them begin to cheer again]
M.C.
Dude, we are total rock stars now!
[takes off his controller and goes to answer the door] Hang on.
Yeah?
Yeah, we did. [smiles]
Wow, really?? [smiles an open smile] Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!
That'd be awesome!
Wow, this is a huge party.
Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! [Ron Zappolo is shown - an elderly gent with gray hair and mustache]
Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there! [a football player wearing #6 is shown] Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!
Are you serious??
Nice to meet you! [grins] I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.
Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
Yeah dude, that's almost impossible.
Really? That'd be sweet.
What, you mean, Kyle?
But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.
Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?
Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play "John the Fisherman"? [Thad stops and launches into that song]
...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick.
This is um, Thad Jarvis.
Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.
I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.
Don't put this all on me, Kyle!
You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-
Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!
Let's just do this, all right? [a new round begins and Stan and Thad resume playing]
It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.
[approaches the counter with a Guitar Hero game guide] Huh?
Hero-Heroin Hero?
And there's no score? No crowds?
[playing quietly] Dude, this is awesome.
Ugh. Damint.
[frustrated] Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play! [misses some more notes] No no, you know what?! Screw this! [the music stops] I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!
Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!
Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!
We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!
You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!
I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! [Mr. Kincaid notices that Stan's tote bag is open and looks inside. He pulls out Heroin Hero]
Man...
Just, just a little.
I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!
No problem.
Huh? What, uh?
The dragon. Where did it go?
No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!
I just wanna find something else to play.
I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?
Stan
Please, ih ih, it won't take long.
I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. ["I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes"]
Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.
That isn't it at all. ["Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand"]
I know. I need you. [Kyle glances over his shoulder, then turns around to face Stan] I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that... [turns around and face Kyle] ...with my best friend.
[awkwardly] Yeah.
I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
What, you mean it?
[pats Kyle on the shoulder] Then let's go, dude! [walks forward. Kyle follows.]
All right, dude, let's do this. [Kyle's jaw drops and Stan is annoyed] What the hell? [what greets them is Randy on the couch in his underwear. Around him are a pizza slice, a bucket of chicken, a case of S'mores Schnapps, and other items. Randy is playing Heroin Hero]
Aw Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!
No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!
You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad! [turns off the console]
Mom, will you get Dad out of here?
That's it?
The List
Dude, Butters, calm down.
Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?
It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.
And then Token, and then me.
Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.
Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?
Who cares what dumb girls think, right? [realizes there's no consolation now and walks away. Kyle stays there looking at the list. Alone. All alone. All alone in the boys' room]
Uh, Wendy. Could I talk to you?
Just for a minute. Over here. [takes her aside, to a tree nearby]
Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.
The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?
[walks up next to her] So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.
Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?
Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?
NO.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
That didn't sparkle with her, did it?
What's going on?
Jesus, dude! [runs out after her. The two other girls give chase]
[breathlessly] Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.
[he and Wendy reach the roof and run up to him] Kyle! Kyle, don't!
The list was a forgery, Kyle!
It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. [a gun is cocked and pops into view, aimed at Wendy]
Kyle
It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.
Wendy!
Wendy! [she steps back and checks herself for bullet wounds, then finds the gun in her left hand. Bebe looks pained, then she checks herself for bullet wounds. Since they're both uninjured, they look around wondering where the bullet went.]
Here, Kyle. [hands the folder to Kyle. Wendy looks inside the bag - she's got herself some free shoes.] We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. [Kyle holds the folder in his hands, but...]
Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?
...Abe Lincoln?
Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they? [smiles. As they smile, they look into each other's eyes. Stan begins to get queasy] Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! [throws up on her twice, and she just takes it as she used to do in third grade.]
Tonsil Trouble
[The boys sit down.] What's going on? Are we in trouble?
[All five boys are surprised.] ...What?
Cartman
Cartman
Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot.
Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?
He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.
Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...
[backs away a bit] Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.
[steps into view] What did he do?
Cartman
Britney's New Look
Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?
[gets off the sofa] And she's at a hotel in our town. [Cartman gets up as well and gets restless]
[thinks a bit, then] Butters, don't be such a pussy.
Oh no.
Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.
I told you that would work!
Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?
Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.
You do?
We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
Oh, thank God.
We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.
Oh no!
[his voice shaking] Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.
Yeah, of course. [begins to help out]
Jesus Christ!
Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.
Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.
What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!
No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!
[annoyed] She doesn't have any lips!
We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.
[strokes his chin and takes a few steps forward] I know where.
We want three tickets to the North Pole. [the clerk stops what he's doing and looks around]
We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. [Kyle and Britney stand behind him. Britney is wearing a wig, sunglasses, and hat as a disguise]
Oh no. [he and Kyle quickly whisk Britney away, the photographers hot on their tails. They pass a room whose door is slightly open. Seconds later they return to it, go in, and shut the door]
Dude, they're never gonna let us through.
It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. [Britney gargles something]
You doing okay, Ms. Spears? [she gargles. From the train's cab, the conductor looks back at Britney and Stan through the cab door's window]
Oh no!
[hops down and grabs Britney's hand] Come on, Britney! [pulls her out the opposite side and into the field] Come on, come on! [as they run, Kyle's hat falls away. They reach the end of the field and enter a clearing. They look around and find themselves surrounded. All sorts of people are there, not just paparazzi. The escape route they just used is closed off by more spectators. Stan looks around and some faces are recognizable, like Irene. Sheila and Gerald show up]
Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?
Sacrificed? For what?
All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!
No wait. [Britney groans. People get close, take pictures, then make way for more people]
Major Boobage
That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?
Yeah, this is not gonna work.
Do you feel anything?
What titties?
Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.
You might also notice by certain phrases your child says to school friends, such as "Hey, let's go cheese." or "Do you feel like cheesing, guys?" or "Dude, I'm cheesing my F-ing brains out right now."
Sheila
Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today.
Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.
Kenny, you home? [Kenny yells some more. Alarmed, the boys open the door and enter the house. They see that Kenny was indeed cheesing. Two cats look back at them.]
Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.
Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.
Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.
He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.
[puzzled] What the hell is he talking about?
I'm sure glad that's over with. [the boys turn left and walk away]
You guys! Check it out. [smiles] It's Kenny. [Kenny has crossed the street to reach a flower patch. He picks one out and inhales deeply] Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.
What the hell kind of flowers are those?
Canada on Strike
[a different crowd shot for each "Canadaaa"]
Border Guard
[large crowd] It's Canaada! On Strike!
Café 180 Patron
[stands up and poses] That's right, suck my Canadian balls!
Canadians:
[the camera zooms out to a view from space of a nation of singing Canadians]
The United Nations, day.
Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on!
God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!
It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. ["Terrance and Phillip" disappears and "Family Guy" comes on]
What'd they say?
I said what what? In the butt
[from behind a big chocolate heart] It's okay
Give it to me, if you please
A Nun
[now in three voices] I said what what? In the butt
Kyle's room. The boys have been watching the video from there
This is going great!
Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.
It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.
Tron Guy
[kicks Tron Guy in the balls, then lands a left hook on his face]
Chris Crocker
We're the ones you told to get Internet money.
Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!
Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.
...Yeah.
Eek, A Penis!
[to Kyle] Dude, wanna do some math problems?
Over Logging
Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things
[sighs] Aw man! [shuts off his monitor as Sharon leaves, then goes to bed. Sharon heads for Shelly's room]
What the hell?
What?
My Internet's not working either.
[heads for a computer] I'm getting on it first.
[steps into Kyle's room] Kyle, I need to use your Internet
What about Starbucks? They have free Internet.
Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!
Transient Man 1
[annoyed] What's so funny about that?
[walks up to her] Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. [she just sits up and punches him away like a beach ball, then lies down without a break in crying]
All right!
Eight fifty one.
Hey! Mom!
It's gotta be our turn soon.
Dad?
Super Fun Time
Ughh.
Naw, I'm with Wendy.
Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.
Sounds like police sirens.
I don't know. [the gunmen gather up the students and adults]
Jesus Christ! [the six of them move away from the window and drop to their knees] We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
Jesus Christ! [the six of them move away from the window and drop to their knees] We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
What?!
Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!
[in no mood to hear about it] This is not the time for that!
Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! [Kyle and Wendy trade places]
Cartman and Butters are at a Thirst For Blood video game. Cartman navigates, Butters fires away half-heartedly
Cartman and Butters skate as a pair on roller skates, then they share an ice cream sundae. A couple walks by and looks at them funny.
Cartman
Cartman and Butters are playing Laser Tagg, except that Cartman is shooting at Butters gleefully. Next, they finally hit the bumper cars. Once everyone is in, the power is turned on. Butters is stuck outside the car, as there's no room for him, so he gets some injuries.
Cartman
Near the entrance, still inside
Wait, you have guns here?
Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!
I can't let them do it. [comes out from under the table] I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. [turns and heads for the door, then exits the building]
Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. [turns around, grabs some dirt, rubs it on his face, and walks to the hostage area]
[walks up] Well howdy there, strangers. [everyone looks at him as he approaches] Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..
I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.
If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?
Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?
He done killed yer pahr.
I know.
The China Probrem
[stops Kyle in his tracks just by saying] Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?
Kyle. [Kyle doesn't reply. Stan sighs, closes the door and approaches him] Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you've got to let this go.
Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.
There was nothing we could do, Kyle! [Kyle walks away. Stan says softly] There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.
How?
You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.
[puts his hands in his jacket pockets] God damn it.
Let's get out of here!
Come on!
Oh God!
I can't watch! [uncovers his eyes and rises from his seat] Let's get out of here Kyle! [leaves. Kenny follows him out of the row, then Clyde, Butters, and Jimmy.]
COME ON LET'S GO! [grabs Kyle by the right hand and drags him out]
JUST RUN!! [the six boys run out of there.]
Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie? [Kyle throws up] Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!
Let's just go, Let's just go! [grabs Kyle's right hand and pulls him away from the theater]
[walks into view] Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle. [walks towards the shore] You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same.
Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.
[turns to face Jimmy] I don't need this now. [looks away and closes his eyes] I just want things to be the way they were! [runs off]
Indiana Jones! All right! [The screen is shown: Indy is at the foot of a long set of stairs]
[happily] You bet, Indiana! [Stan's jaw drops. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas walk up behind Indy, smiling] No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! [they begin to disrobe Indy]
Indy! [Lucas and Spielberg now have Indy pinned to the ground]
No, stop! Raape!
You aren't alone. [he enters the room with Kenny, Clyde, and Jimmy]
We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again. [begins to cry and leans into Kyle's shoulder. Kyle consoles him and begins to cry. The other boys cry as well] I love you.
Wh-why?
Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!
But they raped Indiana Jones!
So, what now?
Breast Cancer Show Ever
What?
I guess so.
What am I supposed to do about it? [Craig and Jimmy walk up to him]
What?
Yeah?
I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. [moves towards the stalls, but Cartman runs up ahead of him and stops him]
Really?
Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.
Ugh, I'm glad that's over with.
Dude, we never thought you were cool.
Pandemic
[pissed off] Oh Jesus, there's another one! [the other boys stop and look. A Peruvian pan flute band plays and draws a small crowd] Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? [the band has a bombo drummer, a siku player, and two charango players]
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
[turns left and leaves] I gotta get home for dinner.
[pumping his fists] God!
I'm outta here; see ya guys. [leaves. Kyle and Cartman follow and Kenny dances again]
They're in London too?
Where's dad?
Why?
Oh Jesus Christ! [Randy walks up behind him with the camera]
You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.
So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
Over two hundred bucks.
Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! [the other boys stay quiet]
Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
Yeah!
Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? [Craig stays quiet, so Cartman prevails upon him and enters his house]
There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.
All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!
Ya see, Craig? [another band starts up nearby and Stan steps forward for a better look. The boys look to their right]
Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. [the other band ignores them and continues playing]
This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! [the other band looks at them for a few seconds, then resumes its music, its members grinning.]
Come on, guys. [the boys return to their spot and start playing again, but another band begins to play off to their left]
Jesus Christ!
Hey, back off!
Eh-excuse us. Hello? [spots a soldier in one of the watchtowers] Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?
No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-
Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.
We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.
We we speak English!
Kyle, calm down.
One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. [the officials look at each other]
Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
[firmly] Yes!
All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?
Pandemic 2: The Startling
We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!
Guinea pigs?
[steps forward] Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.
None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!
Dude, what is this place?
[turns right and walks towards Craig] Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!
Let's see what's in there.
It might be a way out, Craig!
You guys, look at this. [the others go to the wall Stan is looking at] It's a wall of ancient drawings. [first drawing is a group of four men playing instruments]
I know, a-and look. [second drawing is the flute band playing music, which is driving away two giant guinea pigs]
And then the guinea pigs killing people. [they look a little lower] And then... [a boy holds a staff against a giant guinea pig]
Dude, Craig, what's goin' on?
Let's head over this way, guys.
Wow. [they find themselves in a massive complex full of statues whose mouths or noses serve as waterfall fountains. Several suspension bridges connect the mouth of the statue they're in to the other statues]
All right, let's go. [Craig doesn't move]
Wait, whattaya mean no?
Dude, we we have to go check this out.
'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.
Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!
Craig, dude, wait up.
[Craig leads them across an open field] Hey look, there's something here.
No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.
Jesus Christ!
About Last Night...
No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?
Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. [outside the music changes to "Who Let The Dogs Out?" Someone swings from a traffic light and falls. A truck full of young adults rolls by]
Jesus Christ...
[walks in from the dining room] Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here.
Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
[running up to him with Kyle] Dad Dad, we have a problem.
No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.
Dude, he's wasted.
[quite concerned] Dad, what are you doing?!

That's the place we know (get down now)
During this number, the following conversation takes place. At first the boys are silently watching the TV, then
Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.
All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. [holds up his right hand. Kyle holds his right hand up as well, and Kenny holds up his left]
Okay, good.
But you didn't die?

Cartman:
I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.
Stan
[walks up to Wendy] Uh, Wendy?
Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.
I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.
It is?
[brightens up] Really?
What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away. [at an intersection he takes a left turn] I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him. [kids appear behind him and follow him] But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl. [the kids begin to snap their fingers] This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse? [noticing the finger-snapping, he stops walking and looks around. The kids wait for him to start singing and dancing] No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!
No, fuck off. I'm not doing it.
[now hiding behind a corner. Bridon passes by him unaware] Hey, kid, over here. [Bridon looks around and finds Stan, then walks over to him] Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.
Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.
Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me, [gets stern] you're driving everyone crazy.
You don't like doing it?
Basketball?
Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!
[firmly] Yes, you can. What's stopping you?
No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!
When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.
[proud of himself] Sweet.

The school bell rings and everyone goes to class. Stan catches up to Bridon
Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!
Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself! [sees someone down the hall] Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett. [Mr. Garrett, the school coach, is eating an apple] This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.
You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.
Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!
Bridon
[sighs deeply] Ah, shit.
You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.
I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.
You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?
That isn't true! [no one challenges] Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids
[the agents pull away quickly. He notices his next door neighbor looking on from his own doorway] What are you looking at, Robertson? [in a flash he slaps Robertson three times, and just as quickly he's back inside his house and closes the front door.]
God damn it! [walks away. Next scene is him walking down the hall] No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop. [some kids look at him and decide to follow] And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me. [the kids begin to snap their fingers] They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now? [he stops, the kids stop walking but continue snapping their fingers. Soon they smile in anticipation...]
The Gueermo house, night. Mr. Gueermo is getting ready for bed... in an unusual way.
Mrs. Gueermo
[brings his arms up and out, pointing to Bridon at the end with his left hand]
Bridon
[fixes his gaze on his wife, who's terrified for a bit.]
Mr. Gueermo
[Bridon ignores him and opens the door. His father flies through the air and slams the door shut with his body]
Bridon
Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.
Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!
Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!
Look, guys. [gets off the sofa and walks away from the other boys] The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school. [turns around to face them] And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now, [points to them] everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.
[walks into view with the other three boys] That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. [music begins to play]
'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.

While the song is playing, the following happens: Michael is the first to torch some clothes. Henrietta follows with the belts and scarves. Pete begins to torch the jewelry
The Ring
I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.
What?
Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.
[sighs] All right, come on, guys. [leaves the table with Kyle and Cartman.]
Kenny! Hey, hey, Kenny! [Kyle and Cartman are with him]
Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.
[sighs and lowers his head] Oh, boy.
A B.J.?
Yeah, dude, that's gross.
Jonas Brothers
Joe
Joe
So how did it go last night? [Kenny breathes in deep and sighs, takes off his left glove and shows the other boys the purity ring Tammy gave him]
Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a B.J. before you got too old an-
They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
Kenny walks down a side street alone. He looks at his purity ring, still on his finger. Joe leads the Jonas Brothers in a song. Kenny looks out the living room window as Stan, Kyle, and Cartman toilet-paper the houses across the street. Kenny visits Tammy and they both stare at their rings. Kenny stares from afar as Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Butters, Craig and Jimmy put the finishing touch on a snowman - a huge penis and set of balls, propped up by a twig. Kenny walks off, unable to enjoy the project. Kenny and Tammy eat frozen dinners at her table as she studies. Kenny and Tammy watch TV on her sofa, but Kenny is bored and has his head resting on his right hand. A shot of the Jonas Brothers. Kenny looks at two sluts walk by, his left hand stretched out. They ignore him. Kenny and Tammy stand in the middle of the Farmer's Market as people walk by around them. Kenny is back at Tammy's eating frozen dinner. Another shot of the Jonas Brothers. Kenny and Tammy sit on a bench at Stark's Pond. They're in Tammy's living room watching TV again. Now they're in a group meeting of purity couples.
Turns out the Jonas Brothers were shooting a video.
Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!
Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.
[takes the DVD from Cartman and hands it back to Kenny] You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?
[takes Kyle and Cartman aside] You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.
What? [he and Kyle walk up to get a better look - it's Teen Pop Magazine with Jonas Brothers on the cover]
All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! [he and Cartman leave. Kyle stays in place a while, then walks back to Kenny, patting him on the back]
Excuse us. Excuse us.
Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!
Dude, who the hell did that? [a dart hits him in the neck] Hwa? [another one hits Kyle in the neck]
We... don't work for anybody.
We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
The Coon
Who's the Coon?
Not really.
Dude, what the hell?
[opens his door to demonstrate something] Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.
Margaritaville
Do I really have to do this, Dad?
But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.
I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.
Uh, what?
What's all gone?
What do you mean? I have a hundred dollars.
Well, what can I do to get back my money-?
I just opened an account.
No, you just lost it all!
Hey!
Dad!
Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?
Yeah, I think I get it.
Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.
What?
So?
Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?
I wanna return this Margaritaville.
No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.
What?
Wall Street?
So?
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?
My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.
It does?
So I can return it to a bank?
What?!
Aargh! [walks off with the Margaritaville]
I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!
Nnnaaargh!
[surprised] Really? [puts his hands together] Thank you.
What?!
Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
No, dude, that doesn't make sense!
Eat, Pray, Queef
What?! No way Wendy, today's the day!
Oh boy!
We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!
You tell 'em, Cartman!
What? [a girl moves to the front of the group, and lets loose a queef into Butters' face. Butters is stunned and tries to get the queef off his face as if it were skunk musk]
Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.
It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?
Mom, gross! [Sharon and Shelly giggle some more]
Stop it, Mom!
I'm going too. [follows Randy]
Yeah it's different, Mom!
Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.
On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
[coming down the stairs] No way! We did it?! [twirls around] Yeah!!
Mom, we didn't mean... [he and Randy are stunned. Randy walks to the sofa and sits down.]
Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.
Scenes shown during the song: A fire department captain, a car mechanic, a firefighter, a lab technician, a baker, a flight attendant, a doctor, a paramedic, Hillary Clinton, with a queef coming out of her, a dog with five or six puppies at her teats, a pharmacist, a hotel worker, a mother, and an athlete.

South Park, day. Cartman is walking over to Jimmy's house. He enters the house eating chips. Jimmy is working on new jokes.
[walks up to the other guys] What's going on?
During the song, the following happens: Kanye begins to swim like a fish. He spots a yellow fish and lets it circle him a few times. He then hugs it and takes it to the surface. He then gives it a French kiss, then flips backwards into the water with it. He swims again, alone, when a large fish begins to follow him. He notices, swims to it, and begins to rub against it. Then he just swims with it, hugging its belly.
Pinewood Derby
Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?
What is that?
[watching TV] Oh no, he didn't.
Tells?
Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-
It's uh, Marsh. [the official puts the car on a small stand, then measures and weighs it]
[in a resigned voice] Yes I do.
Yeah?
Aw crap, Dad! [the men enter the house and walk past Stan. He closes the door behind them]
Alien?
What does it want?
Dad they aren't here for that.
[whispering] Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.
[whispering] Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.
Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean.
Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.
[alarmed] Kill the alien?
No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.
Dad? [McGee-zax comes in for a closer look]
I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.
No, Dad-
Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?
'Scuse me! 'Scuse me! [the crowd makes way for him as he walks up to the ship] Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! [hands it to the judge]
The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. [the crowd reacts to this admission.]
This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. [everyone, including the world leaders from Kenya and South Korea, hangs on Stan's every word]
Fatbeard
What are you talking about, dude?
[in the kitchen at his house] No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia.
You really think he'll die in Somalia?

Dead Celebrities
Dude, I don't even know who that is.
Are you guys fucking serious?
It's gonna be alright, Kyle.
Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.
Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?
Uh oh.
You're dead, Mr. Jackson!
Accept it! [the various machines start convulsing and sparking]
Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!
Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...
...setting traps for ghosts, no...
Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.
Yeahhhh!
[approaching the judges' table] Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.
Dude, the two male judges love her.
Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.
Woohoo!
Butters' Bottom Bitch
Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!
Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.
Butters, you're the one doing all this?
Butters. Dude!
You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!
Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!
ATΩ frat house, later that night. Only three windows on the second floor are lit now, and an orgy is heard.
W.T.F.
I'm having the best time!
This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! [the other boys cheer this decision.]
[a couple of seconds later] Why did they have us put on long underwear.
Yeah!
Yeah, what are you? A child molester?
Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.
Yup.
We'll see about that!
You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.
You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!
What?!
If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!
Irene, you said you loved me!
Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.
Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!
From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?
Vince McMahon is coming to see us?
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!
Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. [Kyle turns to see the other three boys]
What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother. [Kenny climbs into the ring as El Pollo Loco] And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. [Kenny picks up the chair and swings it into Token, and Stan turns to see him]
Yeah?
He's right.
Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.
And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.
Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.
Yeah yeah, not bad.
Stan
He's here, Ohh my God [Kyle hops off the stool and joins Stan in the chant] Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-
Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?
Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?
It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene. [Coach Connors sneaks up to the side of Cartman's house with a briefcase and puts his back up against the wall]
No, you can't possibly mean that-!
Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you do something informal like that.
When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!
Dude.
What?? [three fights break out in the ring: Cartman vs. Kyle, Jimmy vs. Stan, and Token vs. Butters]
Don't go pointing fingers at me, Cartman! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... [the fighting continues. The crowd gets bored of this unscripted fight]
Whale Whores
[happily] Wow cool.
Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.
What the hell is that? [the trainer turns around. A group of Japanese men in kimonos run towards the pool with harpoons in hand.]
Dad, why did they do that?
Stan
No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.
So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something.
It seems like everyone has an attitude of "that's just the way they are" or "that's just the way it is"! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!
You're not?
Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! [turns and walks out the front door. The boys don't move for a few seconds, then Cartman launches back into "Poker Face".]
Stan's room, sometime later. He's at his desk, pissed off that Cartman and the others don't seem moved by the slaughter. Butters peeks in, then approaches Stan.
[lights up] Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help?
[turns to look at Butters] Really? [gets off his chair] People who are doing something?
[determined] Then that's where I belong.
Sweet! [the Sea Shepherd pulls up alongside the Herro Maru. The whalers gather at the railings and razz the Sea Shepherd]
Yeah. Hell yeah! Let's do it!
Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.
Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!
Wait, that's it?
Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.
[can't believe how toothless their threats are] I thought you guys were pirates in a war!
Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!
What you assholes acted like you were doing? [cries of "ikaban" come from the Herro Maru as it slowly sinks in the ocean and Japanese sailors jump off the ship]
Wait for it... wait for it... NOW! [the crew pulls at the ropes, and the covers comes off the statue - it's Godzilla.]
No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.
...No, I don't care about the show.
I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls!
Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!
Screw this, I gotta get back to work!
Would you mind stepping back a little?
No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.
Oh no, no, NO.
Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
I asked you guys to help me and you said no!
You said "Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"
Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!
Take us out of port! All hands to stations!
As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! [the Sea Shepherd lurches all of a sudden.]
Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!
What? [goes outside with the crew]
What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.
Screw this! Turn hard to port! [takes the wheel and starts turning left]
Dude, fuck you!
What was that? [moments later the crew goes on deck. Stan is with them]
It's like... they know. [two whales latch onto buoys at either end of a net and begin to haul away the crab fishing boat.]
They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.
Jesus Christ! [Everyone looks around as more planes come in and take out the whales surrounding the boat. Two whales take a dive to deeper water, but two planes follow them under and blow up. The whales' corpses float up onto the water's surface.] We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!
[catching his breath] I, I can't, I can't believe it.
Stan
Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!
Guard
You speak English.
Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!
Ummm, where did you get that picture?
Dude, it wasn't actually and dolphin and a whale who bombed Hiroshima. It was the-
Oh, right. Look, I... I think I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?
Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.
Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth. [pulls out a manila envelope and walks to the Prime Minister's desk] Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers. [hands the envelope to the Prime Minister, who opens it and pulls out the "unaltered" photo. The Prime Minister and the officials crowd in to look at the photo.] A chicken and a cow.
The F Word
Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.
Aww! Not those guys again! [the boys leave the pond and head over to the source of the noise - a group of bikers idling at at intersection for no other reason than to revel in the sound of their own bikes' motors]
God! Shut up!
God damn it God damn it!
All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.
Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can- [the bikers roll by on Stan's street, then Stan sighs when they're gone] ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.
...That makes perfect sense, Butters.
Yes, now get out of here.
Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?
[taking notes] Oh that's good.
But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?
Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!
Really nice work, guys.
Yeah, we did that!
Gay people?
Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?
Aw crap!
Yeah, a lot of fags aren't gay.
Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?
Then you're not a fag.
I don't know.
All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?
Right. But you're not thinkin' "Oh, he's a homosexual," you're thinkin' "Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider."
"Bike-curious"! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!
Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.
Aw crap! [drops the basketball]
We can fix this!
That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.
Ohh, it all makes sense now. [the four men walk onto the right side of the stage. The crowd cheers and claps]
There's fags everywhere!
[backing up as far as he can] Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags. [the other boys do as well]
Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.
But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.
...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.
We did it! Yeah!
Today, we've made history.
End of The F Word
Dances with Smurfs
What the hell do you think you're doing?!
I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!
"Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end"!
"Or does she?"
Hey hey, stop reading that!
Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!
Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?
Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.
What?!
Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?
Pee
Stan
We're here! It's the water park! [Randy pulls up at the front entrance and drops the boys off.]
We got it, Dad.
Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?
Dude, this is awesome.
Okay.
Come on Kyle, let's check out the fireboats.
Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.
Yeah, they do, Kyle.
Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.
There are too many minorities (minorities)
There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
At the Zip Line Ride. Cartman is waiting for the car he's in to start moving.
(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
Pi Pi's Snack Shack, later. The other five boys are eating hamburgers.
After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?
Aw come on, Kyle.
Not everybody pees in pools.
Not today... yet.
Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?
Dude, where have you been?
This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
I'm gonna go on the slides.
This is sweet, huh Kenny? [Kenny, who's facing away from the camera, doesn't say anything. A girl in an inner tube floats past the boys, then stops and lets loose some pee. Sure enough, the ground begins to rumble and shake.]
[in a shaky voice] Aaaah! [stops and looks at the pee, and sees a familiar boy floating in the water, face down] OH MY GOD, THEY KILLED KENNY!
[on a small plateau on the attraction] Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!
Well if you don't swim in it you're gonna die!
Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!
[hesitantly] ...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.
Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.
Not... all the time.
Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!
Kyle, come on!
I don't know. [they hear the sobs of a crying man nearby]
Who are you?
...Well, it's not like if you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.
That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?
Just drink the pee, Kyle.
Come on, dude!
All right, they finally came for us. [he, Butters and Jimmy have wide smiles]
Aw come on. It was just a little pee, Kyle.
Sexual Healing
What are you guys doing?
Aw dude, I clocked you!
Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. [Elin gets a new club and her swings get faster]
Hit A and X together.
I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.
Yeah, back in that water level. [looks over at the front door, then back at the game] Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.
Yeah, where's all the fighting?
Yeah, golf is stupid again. [gets off the sofa and tosses his controller onto the sofa, then follows Cartman out]
The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs
All right!
Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
[turns the page] I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said "shit" and "fuck" a few times.
Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. [Kyle breaks into a grin]
[runs into the living room in a panic] Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!
Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!
Well dude, somebody has got to go down!
Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!
Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. [Butters walks in hanging his head]
Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!
What? Hey! [Butters is pleased for once]
Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole! [two girls rush up to Butters' aid]
God-damnit!
More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!
Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!
What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!
What?
There's nothing about liberals or conservatives!
I can't believe they won't ban our book!
Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. [he and Kyle walk away]
So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!
[in store with the other boys] Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. [grins]
You can't be serious! You people like this?!
God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!
They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!
Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.
Medicinal Fried Chicken
Hey it looks different.
A what?
What'd they say?
The doctor? But Dad, we wanna eat.
[opens the sliding door and looks out] Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.
You Have 0 Friends
[walks in] Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?
Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be out playing video games.
Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?
Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!
I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
Who?
You guys are retarded, I'm playing Xbox. [turns around and walks out.]
Yeah, Dad, I was kinda forced to.
[looks over his shoulder] No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.
...Dad, you are my friend.
Dad, it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!
I just wanna do my homework!
Alright, Dad, I'll add you!
[stops moving, then turns around] What?
...Um, no?
Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-
Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.
How?
Okay, I'm sorry!
"Edit profile. Basic... settings" Jesus Christ!
...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!
Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.
Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously! [an update pops up] What the hell is this?! Podcast?
Sure dude. [Kyle enters, still sniffling] Dude, what's the matter?
What?
Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you.
NO.
Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!
[frustrated] Ah, FUCK.
Okay it says I'm at your farm.
'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.
What?
...I have no idea.
[turns to see her walk off] Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! [turns around and continues on his way. He walks by an electronics store]
Fine! [continues walking, but a car pulls up next to him.]
[looks at him like he's crazy] I don't know you!
...Dad, I didn't even wanna do th-
[squeezes his eyes shut and stays still for a moment] No. NO! Screw this! You know what? "Edit Profile > Update Profile." There! "Delete Profile"! [reads the popup] "You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel" Proceed! [presses "Proceed," then reads the next popup.] "Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No." Yes! "Are you totally sure?" Yes! [clicks on it and his screen goes black. A blinking amber cursor appears]
You can't let me do that? What are you talking about? [his monitor has a built-in Webcam]
Delete Profile! "Are you totally sure? Yes or-" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete! [the webcam lights up and shoots a laser at Stan's forehead, knocking him back on his chair. It then sets up boxes of energy around his body] Hey Dad? [the camera begins scanning him in bit by bit, pixel by pixel] Dad? [He disappeared from his chair and he transported through the webcam. He soon appears on a virtual floor after traveling down some tunnels] Oh dude, what the fuck? [Neon lights appear all over]
Profile? I'm not a profile.
AAH. [The guards escort Stan away]
Excuse me, my name is-
Eh hey, could you tell me how I-
[realizes where he is] Aw Goddamnit I got sucked into Facebook!
Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?
No, I seriously don't want any more friends.
Okay I'll be your friend.
Awww!
Why oh oh?
Yahtzee?
Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
[rolls and gets five 4s] Yahtzee. [the other profile gasps and vanishes in a fair bit of pain]
I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!
My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!
Oh yeah? I can try! [turns around and walks through a wall]
You're an asshole, Kyle!
What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!
Dude! Fuck your crops! [walks up to Kyle's corn and starts ripping the stalks up]
Where?
Son of a bitch! [runs back to the barn he came out of]
Jesus Christ.
Has anybody seen my stupid profile?!
Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up! [everyone shuts up and looks at him] Where is profile Stan Marsh! [the room begins to rumble]
Oh...
What do you want from me, dude?!
Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!
Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
Fuckin' Yahtzee again? Seriously? [his giant profile takes a seat and rolls the dice]
Yahtzee.
Yahtzee. Sixes.
Awgh! [catches his breath. With his profile destroyed, Stan sees that he has 0 friends.] Oh thank God.
My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.
Fuck off, Dad. [turns off the monitor and leaves his desk.]
200
Oh God, you guys, really? This again? [the students all move to the next spot in the tour]
You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! [everyone moves on except Butters, who spots something]
Huh? [Tom Cruise is packing fudge into boxes with a hat pulled low over his face] Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!
Then why are you packing fudge?
Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.
For what?
But dude-
I have no idea...
Aww... he was packing fudge!
It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-
Ooooooo...
I saw him once. [everyone turns towards Stan]
Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.
No, dude, it was totally fine.
Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...
Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.
Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!
Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.
Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!
What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.
No, you can't even show his feet.
Muhammad, are you okay? [Runs toward Muhammad and helps him up]
They want his power?
Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.
We made a promise... to Jesus! [Randy steps forward]
Dude, we can't do that
201
It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!
Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad.
When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!
If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!
Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!
Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.
The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.
[a bit surprised] ...Yeah.
Dr. Mephesto, we need your help!
Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!
Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.
Come on, guys, we're running out of time! [more knocking is heard at Mephesto's door, and Mephesto turns around]
That's not cool!
We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!
Oh crap, the gingers!
What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?!
Joseph Smith
Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. [everyone stops and gasps. The "CENSORED" bar disappears and Tom is shown again]
[smiles and tilts his head to one side] Yeah.
Oh dude, look. [Cartman is shown on a gurney, crying. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach him] Hey, Cartman...
Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.
Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.
We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!
We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.

There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! [Towelie is shown lighting a joint as the camera pulls away]

Why not?
[faces Cartman] Cartman, tell us.
Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.
Dude, noo, you- you don't know that.
Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!
Dude, you are so retarded!
It's a Jersey Thing
You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, "Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."
Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
No, uh, it just explains a lot.
Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.
Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
[climbs in behind him] Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?
Dude, what are you doing?
[tries to get out, but finds the doors locked] Try to find a way past it!
Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?
[flatly] Why? [Kyle continues writhing and throws his hat away]
Dude.
Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.
I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling "Muff cabbage," what's muff cabbage?
Insheeption
A note?
[omitting the names] We need to talk.
[approaching] Is something wrong, Wendy? [Wendy sees him, then looks at the girls, gets up and walks up to Stan]
My locker?
Are you serious?
Well it's just a little messy.
Aw come on.
Yeah, alright.
What, come on, it's not that bad.
My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.
Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.
Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-
Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-
Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.
Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-
Well, I- I guess so, but- [Dr. Chinstrap dumps the baggie into the large trash bag his assistant is holding. The assistant is wearing a facemask] Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? [Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny look at each other worriedly]
Well no, don't throw that out.
[begins gathering up the papers] No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-! [takes the bottle from Dr. Chinstrap. The assistant pulls out the baggie] G-give me back my sandwich! [Stan grabs the baggie, then reaches for another loose sheet, when he realizes what he's done. Cartman makes a circle around his right ear with his index finger and whistles a cuckoo tune]
I don't... I don't know.
Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... "hoarding."
Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?
[looks around again] Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?
[looks around and picks up an empty milk carton from a box] Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-
What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?
What the hell's going on?!
Mr. Mackey.
Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?
Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!
Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.
I'm working on it!
[walks up to Mackey and turns him around] Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! [something hits Mackey's window and he goes to see what it was. He sees Billy on the sidewalk with his friends]
Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?
Oh-Ohhhhhhh.
Wait wait, where the hell are we now?
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!
Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.
Dad? Is that you?
Where are you?
The hell are you doing, dad?
Did you come here to help me?
Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!
DAD!
[moaning in frustration] Aaaaaagh!
Who's that?
What the fuck?
Mr. Mackey, stop running!
Look, dude! [catches up to Mackey and stops him] Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.
Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.
Shut up!
You can do it Mr. Mackey.
What the hell?
Who are you people?
Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?
...So then why aren't we waking up?
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!
[thinks a moment] I think I have a better idea.
Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.
Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!

You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!
Awww what?!
No, dad! No!
Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!
Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!
Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.
Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!

You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.
...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.
Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.
Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! [another camera crew comes in, with another chef]
Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.
HUMANCENTiPAD
Let me see your iPad, Cartman.
What?
Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
[earnestly] I do.
We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.
Oh boy.
For what?
Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.
Okay, the Geniuses will see us now. [the group leaves their seats and head to the Genius bar, but Stan stops them midway] Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. [Stan leads the group forward]
Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.
69ingchipmunks@me.com [Gerald is surprised]
Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.
[looks at the boy] No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.
I think Verizon.
Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?

[smiles, but notices Jimmy's silence] What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.
All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. [the cafeteria doors fly open and a bunch of armed actors rush in, led by Adam Sandler and Jay Leno]
Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-

Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side. [continues directing until the poster is on just right] Yeup. [Cartman stands defiant until the poster is up. The girls begin to enter the hallway]
The winds of change are blowin'.

Hey, Mr. Takiyama, did you know that China and Japan are actually uh different countries?
You're Getting Old
[opening his gift] Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters.
Oh thanks, dude.
Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?
Mom, I'm 10 years old now.
We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
That sounds like shit!
I know, Mom. I love you too.
It's okay, Mom. I understand.
'Night. [Sharon turns off the lights and closes the door. A few seconds later, Stan opens his eyes and looks at the door to make sure his mom isn't looking at him. Then he reaches under the mattress and pulls out his iPod] Haha. [listens to some music. Soon some shitty sounds creep in] Ugh. [tries some other tracks, but each one has poop noises in it. He sits up] What the hell? [tries more tracks, but all he hears now is shit]
Hey dudes.
Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?
Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.
No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.
It... kind of sounds like shit.
No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close. [has Kyle listen to a track] You don't hear shit?
That doesn't sound like shit to you?
And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.
Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.
I just turned 10.
So this is normal?
Sounds like shit.
Uh that sounds like shit too.
Yeah dude, it's just shit.
They both look the same. [true enough, except for the turds]
No.
They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.
Oh no.
Hey guys.
He said I have cynicism?
Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.
Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?
How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.
That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
[looking at his chocolate sundae] Aw, dude, this looks like shit.
It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.
Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.
What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.
Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.
Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?
Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. [just outside, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny walk by, not noticing Stan in the diner. Stan, on the other hand, notices them walk by. He quickly leaves the booth and catches up with them outside, where they're happily talking about something.]
I thought you guys were sick! [the other boys don't know what to say]
Dude, you totally lied to me!
Where were you guys going?!
Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
You guys... don't wanna be around me?
Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.
I won't say a word.
Oh shit.
Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! [apparently trailers are still playing]
Awww God! [squeezes his eyes shut and puts his hand over them]
Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry.
How can you say that looks good?!
[shields his eyes from the shit] Ugh.
But it's just crap.
Oh come on, people!
Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry.
Me?! Did you see that shit?!
Hang on guys!
Kyle?
I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?
Ass Burgers
[in an angry outburst] God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! [looks around glaring at everyone, who look back at him, stunned]
[after a few seconds' silence] I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? [tears start to well up around his eyes]
Wait, it's not a real illness?
[gets off the sofa and walks towards the door] Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this!
[turns around] Yeah.
Who are you people?
Huh?
Aliens?
Because of aliens? [crosses his arms]
Yeah I'm ready!
Ahhhh! [walks around town looking at it with a new sense of wonder, but his walking is off] Oh coool!
[laughs rather heartily, looking drunk] Adam Sandler's funny.
[sees him] Kyle! [falls into Kyle's arms]
[his speech is slurred] Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!
Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.
[squints his eyes] But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! [turns around excitedly]
You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!
...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? [Cartman walks over, drying his hands off in the process]
Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!
[a couple of seconds of silence, then Stan gives him the finger.] Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit! [Kyle sighs and walks back to the burger stand] ...Kyle, I love you. [Kyle reappears a few seconds later, and Stan gives him the finger again.] You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you! [Kyle turns heel and walks back towards the stand] ...I love you. [Kyle does not return]
I feel like total shit.
The rock creatures?
Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...
Ugh God.
[falls onto the floor] Aughah. [gets up and starts firing indiscriminately, moaning all the while. He falls on his back, fires off a few more shots, turns his head to his left side, and throws up. He passes out]
[sniffs and then smacks his lips a bit, finally waking up] ...Enchirito?
What? You guys are aliens?
Dude, I don't know!
I'm not friends with him.
No, no, we don't hang out anymore.
Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!
I don't know!
Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
How do you guys make them so yummy?
[panicking, but with great restraint] Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger
No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.
Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!
Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.
Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!
No, I'm done with that! [slaps it away from the member's hand]
I don't want everything to go back to the way it was! [suddenly calm] I, I don't. [he steps over the broken bottle, leaves and joins the other kids, who have returned] You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town. [approaches one boy] Maybe this kid will become my new best friend. [then another] Or maybe this kid will.
Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. [a horn and the sound of wheels stopping are heard]
[his face drops] What?
No, dad, no. No, please!
No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.
...K, coming. [hops out of bed and puts on his coat, going through the motions. He walks out to join the boys, but a few seconds later he returns to open a drawer, pull out a bottle of whiskey, opens it, takes a swig of it, closes it, and puts it back in the drawer. He doesn't bother to put on his shoes. He closes the drawer and heads back into the hall]
The Last of the Meheecans
Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.
You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco.
Base! [the others turn to see Stan in their midst]
So, so then, so then the pope says, "Maybe you should go check the toilet." [most of the other boys laugh]
Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.

Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.

What about him?
Turn it up. [Cartman obliges]
No way.
The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!
Come on dude, it's pretty funny.
Yeah dude, that's pretty funny.
Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her "soft-serve Simon."
Come on, dude, it's pretty funny!
I wouldn't care.
What?
[sees Kenny and walks up to him at his locker] Kenny! Kenny, what the fuck?!
How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!
Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!
That was a private e-mail from me to you! [notices a pissed-off Wendy approaching] Hey Wendy.
No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.
Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.
This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all! [The others present are Red, Kenny, Butters, Craig (looking at his iPhone), Wendy, Kyle, Bebe, and Token. Kyle raises his hand] Yes, Kyle.
Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!
Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room! [the other eight look at each other] Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch! [pounds the podium with his fists] And we're not gonna-!
What? How do you know?
We only have music class on Thursday.
Oh I'm ready!
Don't let him get away!

Kyle

Stan
Hi. Does a Vernon Trumski live here?
Come on, guys! [charges in with the other kids. Mrs. Trumski is about to close the door when Catatafish floats in]
Quick, we need something to carry him in!
We just need to borrow him, kid. [Kyle hands the box to Butters]
[walks up to Vernon] Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!

From out of nowhere Mr. Adler and Mr. Mackey toss a bound and gagged Cartman onto the road and watch as the bus runs over him. Principal Victoria is with them. The bus rolls a bit further, but stops due to a broken muffler. The door opens and the group steps out
Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!

The music room, moments later. Wikileaks types furiously to get the scoop out: "SCHOOL FACULTY TRIES TO POISON STUDENTS!!" Stan leads the group into the music room

God this sucks!
Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!
Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
That's what we mean by "grow up" dude! Stop being a baby!
Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.
Yeah.
Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?
[walking out from behind a garage] Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.
Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Dude, what the hell?
A History Channel Thanksgiving
We all have to do this report together, dude.
Dude, it is called History Channel.
...What?
'bout what?
That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?
Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. [smiles]
I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?
I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.
Dude!
Yeah, go on dude!
I didn't think so.
[looking at the driver] Who's this?
Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.
It's cool dude, we understand.
Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.

We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.

They are trying to save Clyde's mom.
They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.
We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.
So then we can't sue him?
Wow, really?!
How expensive?
[holds the money] Yeah.
So what does that mean?
Cash For Gold
[looks away to avoid eye contact] Thanks. [Kyle takes notice]
[annoyed] Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.
[angered] It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!
Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
[finally breaks, facepalming] I know! [lowers his right arm] I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!
No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.
...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
Fifteen bucks?!
Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of! [takes back the bolo tie]
Yeah! Here's one. [turns into the next store past the empty lot. The man outside is wearing a signboard]
Yeah dude, you can test them.
[stunned, then angry] This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!
I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. [hands the bolo to the clerk. The clerk looks it over, brings out his own pocket scope, and looks it over more closely]
A six-layer burrito?
Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?
But, how do they get away with that?
What are you talking about?
Grandpa? [gets off the sofa and runs out the front door]
Grandpa.
She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa.
She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen.
Yes, Grandpa.
Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! [turns to his left and leaves with determination. Marvin is left looking distressed]
Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself?
I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?
I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.
No i wouldn't.
No, because I really want you to kill yourself.
I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!
Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.
I'm not joking. [pause] Do it.
Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!
Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: "Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"
YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!
You're not?
[railing at an older Indian boy] You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! [Kenny and Kyle are with him]
Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa! [the boy reaches for a necklace and offers it to Stan] No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! [the boy thinks about what to do with the necklace, then reaches for a small plastic pouch and puts it in. The boy motions to another boy]
Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.
So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. [hands him the gift]
Yeah.
Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore.
Faith Hilling
Tango, Tango, I'm in position.
It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this. [Butters takes a plate from the trolley, which has an iPhone on it, and walks to the left. Meanwhile Kenny comes from the opposite direction, taking the iPhone and passing it to Stan.] I got it.
Go, go, go.
South Park Elementary. The fourth graders come out, almost all having concerned looks on their faces. Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman and Butters walk together.
Oh, that's a good idea.
Dude, we are on the front page!
Can we get a different pose, please? [hands the clerk two dollars and gets the paper]
It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.
[reads the newspaper] Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.
[continues reading] "Faith Hilling is pretty stale," said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. "If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive."
That's all it is? [Kenny moves to the left-hand side]
Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.
Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
That's a cool idea
What seems pointless?
No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.
Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
[continues to crawl around] Oh Long Johnson, Oh Long- [he is confronted by Stan, Kyle and Kenny]
Oh, hey, guys. How's it going? [hurriedly puts his pants on]
Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.
Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay? [the boys stop] You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. [Kenny looks down]
You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. [Kenny pulls down his pants and starts crawling on his butt.]
[has the iPhone in his hands, while Kyle and Kenny stand next to him] Okay, that's good, a little higher.
OK, whenever you're ready.
Alright, go Cartman.
Yeah, that's cool. It's awesome.

Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?
That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.
Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.
I can't believe what I'm hearing! [three girls walking by hear this and stop] This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!
I'll do it! I'll be in charge.
No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped.
Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, [takes Clyde and Red and turns them around] over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying? [guides them back into the school] At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!
Bullying isn't cool. Bullying is lame.

Kyle? Kyle, dude, where are you going?!
To stop bullying.
YES.
...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Do you realize that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-
Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference!
What the hell does that mean?
Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!
Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!
I know, right?! [Stan, Cartman, and Kenny all imitate Butters' pain]
Oh, hey.
Huh?
But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-
No.
[Stan Sobbing.]
What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?
Butters is totally fine with it, dude.
Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!
Oh yeah.
This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!
...What, what was the question again?
...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!
[left wondering] Why does he keep saying that?
Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it. [the audience applauds]
I didn't know.
I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!
Huh? Aw, come on! [comes across Clyde, Craig, and Cartman and stops] Dude, what's going on?
Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?
How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?
[moves off a bit] Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago.

I'm gonna jack it where the sun always shines. (He's gonna jack it)

[running towards the camera] No!
Help! We're trapped! [A shot of all four boys bloodied and woozy] We've gotta get out of here!

Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?
I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.
Yeah.
[being interviewed] And we were like, "Other? We have to do this with other people?" [a shot of the boys entering the waiting room, where there are seven other people waiting]
[mimicking] Good. How are you?
[being interviewed] It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. [return to the tour]
[being interviewed] "Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?"
...Shuttle?
Uh that's okay.
Thank God. [everyone is out of the van as Guide 1 goes up to the launch pad two stories up. The pad is attached to a pine tree]
I think we're good.
[being interviewed] So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! [Cartman is hooked up]
[as Kyle is prepped] Oh, really??
[being interviewed] And it was like WHAM. [makes a fist with his right hand and punches his left handn with it.]
There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
[being interviewed] That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!
Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?
[being interviewed] So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.
Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?
[runs up to the tour guides] Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.
...Yyyeah.
Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.
Yea, please!
You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up!
No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!
[being interviewed] I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought "I can find us a way out!" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it.
[returns from his search quite excited] You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!
We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!
Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! [an announcer says the following lines]
[being interviewed] The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
...Kenny? Kenny! [Kenny has slid down on the seat, but his eyes are open]
[being interviewed] And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said "Stop it!"
[rises and walks a bit] Stop it! It was me! My idea.
Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining. [reaches into his pocket and pulls out the brochure for Backcountry Adventures, then looks at it for a few seconds] I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. [Kyle and Cartman look at each other]
[turns to face them] If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. [the camera pans down and sure enough, the offer is on the brochure cover: Sign up 3 friends and get an iPod NANO!!!]
I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
[being interviewed, crying] The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back. [wipes away the flowing tears] I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.
Thank you. [whispers] Mr. Hankey. [Mr. Hankey has landed on the boat, at the top of an armrest]
Cartman Finds Love
What? [most of the fourth grade boys gather around]
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
South Park Elementary, playground, recess. As the kids play and chatter, Token is pushing Nichole on a swing, then he tickles Nichole and she giggles. Cartman is rather pleased with how things are progressing between Token and Nichole
Dude, why are you so into their relationship?
Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.
As Brad sings, Kyle and Nichole look at each other and smile, then look at Brad. Nichole notices someone clear across the center. It's Token, with Craig and Clyde. Token still has a heavy heart, keeping his eyes focused on the floor while Craig and Clyde smile. Kyle looks at Nichole, who's still surprised to see Token there, and grins at her. She looks back at Kyle and smiles. Outside, a tour bus drops Cartman off near the center and Cartman runs for it.
End of Cartman Finds Love
Sarcastaball
You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.
The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.
Dad, do we really have to wear bras?
This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
Fan 1
Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.
[stops and faces his friends] I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.
[walks up to Butters] The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.
Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
Cartman, you idiot!
Dad?
What?
Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!
Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!
We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says "Competitiveness can be compassionate," he's being completely sincere?
Yeah Dad. You need some of this. [walks forward and gives him a small bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo. Randy takes it and opens it, looking at the contents, then drinks it]
Raising the Bar
You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?
Whoa duude!
They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. [Indeed, a small fleet of them are available for rent, at $19.99 each. They're labeled as electric wheelchairs. Obese people are in line as one after another of them rents a Rascal. The boys turn a corner to have a look at the Rascals as they're being rented]
Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?
Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.
James Cameron
Token's office, nicely appointed. some loud pounding is heard on the door
I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?
[alarmed, gets up and walks up to Kyle] Dude! Dude, not cool!
Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
Yeah dude. It's really serious.
James Cameron
Dude, you okay? [Honey Boo Boo gets up, and Cartman turns back to strike her down again]
End of Raising the Bar
Insecurity
Dude, what happened?
What's this? [Takes the sheet and looks at it.]
Whoa!
But are you sure they had sex, like, "sex" sex, or they actually had sex? [Randy sees a plant nearby, quickly dumps his coffee into it, and puts the cup against Stan's door]
Well are you gonna tell your dad?
Cartman dude, not now.
You're gonna have to tell him, dude.
Going Native
What?
You're talking about Butters.
Butters?
Butters, come out here.
Hawaii?
[Turns to the basket] After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. [Makes a shot at close range]
[reading the letter] "On the morrow"? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?
A luau, day. All the natives are in line for lunch before the ceremony begins. Butters stands on a platform before the chief while Kenny watches on
A Nightmare on Face Time
[gets his gift] We're rich?
[somewhat confused] Blockbuster Video?
Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. [they reach their destination and exit the car, and have a look at the place]
It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.
[turns and walks to Sharon, who's at the counter looking up things on the ancient CRT monitor] I think something might be wrong with Dad?
Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom.
[takes up the shield and strikes a pose] Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!
[disappointed] Dad, nobody's gonna come.
Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!
[moments later, on the land line] I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!
I know, but there's nothing I can do.
I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.
Oh never mind, I hate him again.
Yeah.
How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.
Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house.
Trick or treat.
Trick or treat.
What? What's he doing?
Hey, where did you guys go?
All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!
Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!
No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad! [the robber scratches the glass, leaving a deep gash] Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt
No no! We weren't gonna go there!
NO! [shakes his head] I won't say anything, I promise! [Robbers 2 and 3 take the iPad out to the car]
What are you gonna do? [Robber 3 takes the iPad out and carries it away] Please! Please just let me go! No!
What the hell? [gets off the stool and walks over to Shelly] Shelly I need to use your cell phone.
Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?
Oh, ah thank God you found me.
You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! [Ben and his girl look at each other]
They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
Guys, you're okay!
It's all right, just a scratch.
No! They're looking for you there! [to Sgt. Yates] Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash.
Yeah, people are gonna get hurt.
Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.
Oops.
Hey, be careful in there.
It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps.
Wait a minute. There they are!
Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- [some rustling is heard and Randy takes Stan's iPad from him]
[gaining control of his own iPad] It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?! [Officer 3 takes the iPad off and throws it away while he keeps getting shot, and finally falls over dead. The gunfire stops]
Hey dude.
It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK. [Kyle does so, and the indicator disappears] You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me.
Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?
Stay gold. [the iPad runs out of juice and the screen goes black, except for some symbols indicating the iPad needs to be recharged. Cartman roars like Hulk.]

It's all right, Dad.
All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.
Yeah I know.
Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.
I don't know, [looks at his wristband] I just like it.
Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off.
...I don't know. [checks his wristband again] I like it.
No, I just, I don' know. No.
I have?
You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?
You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters?
...Farmers in where?
Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?
Wow, this is happening so fast.
[looking out over a river from a stone bridge] My friends told me I was crazy, [jogging down a sidewalk in a Nike jogging suit] that I was wasting my time. [holding court at a press conference. Cameras all around him take pictures] But my cause is to stand my ground. [sits in a park, then stands up as the sun sets] When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand... [faces the sun and raises his left arm, still wearing the bracelet. It begins to glow] for standing.
No thanks. I'll stand.
I'm good.
Tell the captain to take off. [At the gym] People ask me, "You never took the bracelet off? Not once?" [outside, with a sunset behind him] No. Never. Not. Ever. [Three phrases pop up onscreen: "STAN for something. STAN up. STAN ground."] What do I do? I Stan ground. [a double swoosh appears onscreen]
For what?
No! This is stupid!
No! I never cut if off!
What's the big idea, Craig?!
You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!
You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!
And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!
Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!
Yeah. [the door opens and Kyle enters]
Thanks Kyle.
Why does it matter?!
You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!
[hops off his bed and walks over to his desk] Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!
You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?! [Kyle looks around at all the Nike merchandise] This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!
Jesus!
What are you doing here?
Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?
Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that.
It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.
Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.
Thanks a lot. [the scientist turns around and leaves.] Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?
NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.
Pff it's like, that's here [puts his hand up, palm down, about two inches above the bread] and...
Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!
Exactly! People don't even know where it is.
How can we raise awareness?
Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...
Our... scause?
Stan
People are saying that? [pleased]
Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.
[looks heavenward] We did it. [Butters goes around a corner and out of view]
[glares at Kyle] Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! [a bouncy noise is heard]
It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.
We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.
Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
[after a long while] What would Jesus do? [Rocky fanfare plays and Jesus slowly gets energized. He gets off the sofa and walks to the dining room table, reaches into his robe and pulls out a big bottle of HGH. He plants it on the table and opens it. He pours some into the cap and drinks it. He transforms into a superhuman and flips the dining room table over. He turns and breaks through the front wall, obliterating the front door, and runs off to find the charlatan. Stan looks on] Yeheah! [Jesus goes to the Scauses factory and flips over every truck he finds in his way, then bursts into the factory. He beats up all the workers there]
Obama Wins!
Wow, really? That's pretty impressive.
But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.
I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.
Is that an M&M?
Pry his mouth open!
What'd he say? [Kenny mumbles his reply and Stan understands that] Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? [Butters mumbles a reply]
Huh?
Oh, Red Lobster.
Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman: [Freeman turns around and faces the group] How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?
There's nothing here, Kyle. [Jimmy walks in from the dining room]
He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.
Oh my God you guys, look! [points across the street. The boys walk out as the sound of a large vehicle is heard] Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship! [Indeed. The ship arrives and positions itself for landing, then descends onto the road. After a big thud, the ship's door opens... and out swaggers Mickey Mouse]
Aw shit, it's him again.
Well, we tried, dude.
Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?
Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?
Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010?

Wow.
N.S.A. Headquarters, Maryland, day. Cartman walks in, dressed in a suit and wearing a fake mustache, and approaches the front desk.

You guys are watchin' murder porn?
Okaaay. [turns around and walks out. Sharon switches back to the show]
What's up dude?
Yhh, yeah, the first grader?
...What?!
What happened?
[miffed] What?
You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. [closes his eyes]
That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
What?
Butters, what happened?
In Minecraft.
Whattaya mean?
It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. [police sirens are heard]
Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!
What, dude?
So?
Aha! [the boys reach the floor]
You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!
No no, [whips out a list and reads it] just ID Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.
Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?
We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
No, that's way too long!
Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other! [the men stop rubbing] Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?
What?
I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
I... said it would really bum them out.
Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.
World War Zimmerman
Is he doing it again?
Cartman, are you feeling alright?

South Park Elementary, Room 7. The kids are in their seats, and the PA system comes on.
How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?
[enunciating] What the fuck?
Hey Kyle.
Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.
...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?
You like... how they smell? How they taste?
They're really that good?
Should I try them?
...Kyle, maybe you should get some help.
I don't get it, Kenny.
Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.
Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.
Hey Kyle.
Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.
If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.
All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
See? You sound like a dick.
Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.
I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!
Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been [Stan's phone rings] So- sorry, hang on. [pulls the phone out of his jacket pocket and answers it.] Hello?
No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!
You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all "Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"
You should apologize to Kenny too.
The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.
Black Friday
[stands on his chair] It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?
The House of Greyhawk?
I like the PS4's controller better.
[tears welling up] The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because... [gets mad] because that's how XBox people are.
[determined] If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.
We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?
Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!
No, you can't do that!
Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.
Exactly!
...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!
And who do we have on our side?
Did you ask the Vamp kids?
[walks towards the tent's entrance] There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. [looks at the campfire outside, around which sit Tweek and two other boys]
So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own! [the army is shown, and it includes the Goths, the Vamps, the handicapped kids, and some first graders. The house behind them only has one story, and it looks run down. A security grill is falling off one of the windows and the fence is in tatters. The army cheers for itself] I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided. [more cheering. A familiar figure sits on a throne...] Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! [he turns around and unsheathes his sword, raising it to honor the new leader]All hail the Princess! [points the sword at her, and more cheering follows. Princess Kenny, Lady McCormick, has arrived]
A Song of Ass and Fire
Let them pass! [the PS4 army makes way for the XBox army. Cartman is carried over to Kenny's throne]
[translating] The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose. [Kenny plays with the hair on his wig]
The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.
The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.
What I started? How dare you!
I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
The gods will find us a way!

Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here. [points to the location] Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. [points to a location outside cardboard Red Robin]
The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.
I have no idea.
Yes?
What? [moments later, outside, Stan walks towards Cartman as the two armies face each other]
So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. [turns around and walks away]
And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
[turns around] Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. [as he walks away with Jimmy and Craig, the camera reveals that Kyle had his fingers on the hand behind his back crossed during the swear.]
Yeah, sure, what about it?
Why?
Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.
Who is that?
Did Kyle know about this?
Did Kyle know about this?!
[startled out of his sleep] Huh? Hello? Who is that? [next to him is a glass of milk, a sandwich with a bite in it, and a tin cup]
Get out of here!
You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
[stands and turns to address Kyle] I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!
...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
Get out of here! I'm done with you! [grabs the tin cup and raps it against his bedroom 'jail cell' door as in classic prison movies] Mom! Mom! [Kyle stands up straight] Get him out of here! [Sharon arrives, and Kyle back away from the door] Get him out! [Kyle leaves]
Shopper 10
We're done with betrayals! It's time to put an end to this!
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block. [stops between the two presidents] Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad? [throws his sword at the Sony president] Then you fucking fight!
[flatly] Yay.
Yes, it is.
Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?

Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.

South Park Elementary, playground, day. The boys are gathered on the merry-go-round, looking at pictures of the cheerleaders on Craig's phone.
Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?
A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.
Wendy, why is it such a big deal?
[looks down] I do? [kids begin to walk by]
Hang on a minute, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [calls up Kim yet again] Bitch, remember when you went off to kill that dragon with them dwarves? ... Yeah. Oh yeah. Rightrightrightright, yup. Yup, I got it. Yep, love you too. [blows two quick kisses at the phone, hangs up, and resumes the shoot.]
It wasn't no dragon, so my girl ain't no hobbit.

No, we don't wanna do anything.
...Nnnno, there isn't. [turns back to his computer and fleshes out the project]
What?
I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman.
[lowers his head and strokes his chin] Washington Redskins. [raises his head] I like it!
[walks up to Kyle] You alright dude?
What?! [Cartman walks up to Butters]
I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.
Yeah...
I just... never saw myself owning a company called "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."
Why don't we just call it "Untitled Startup Company"?
Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.
I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.
Good luck with your company, dude.
It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here. [walks up to the boys] Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.
And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,
Boy, this is the life, huh guys?
But you all thought our name was sweet.
Gluten Free Ebola
Morning!
[walks up] Hey Wendy.
Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.
So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.
Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.
Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? [Wendy closes her locker and faces him]
[joins them on the floor] For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.
What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. [Pink's "Get This Party Started" begins to play, which serves as transitional music to the next scene]
Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.
Sweet!
Excuse me?
Wait, wait, ah I might need those.
We can't let our party suck.
[looks down, then] I'll be back. [turns and leaves]
Dad? Dad!
Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?
Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?
Nonono, not yet. DAD!
Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!
Let me talk to my dad! [the soldier finally hauls him away]
There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.
I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-
Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...
We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!
Stan
Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.
What does that mean?
End of Gluten Free Ebola

Sharon
Sharon
What is that?
Cartman's a girl now?
[surprised] What?
Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside? [Randy sighs deeply and stands up to walk] I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?
...What?
Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?
Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl.
Stan
[this is all too much for Stan to take in, and he passes out. Randy notices] Stan?
...I don't know where I belong...
I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.
The image of me that you see
And I will push (push)
And so I push
Yah yah yah
[While the song plays, the following montage flows: camera closes in on Randy's face, then on a toilet. Some of the lyrics, handwritten on yellow rule paper, scroll past. Stan looks at the restrooms again. More lyrics. The demos are playing for the record producer and Ron, and they like it. More lyrics. Two sisters listen to the song on an iPhone in the kitchen. Their mother Carol looks on from the doorway. She returns to the office the next day and stops the boss from putting up the transgender sign on a bathroom. They both listen to the song, and like it. Shelly is wearing her headphones joyfully dancing to the song. Randy looks in and smiles. Principal Victoria waves a pencil around as if she were conducting an arrangement for this song. Bebe is listening to it with Milly and Nelly in her bedroom. Butters is in his own room wearing a pink tutu and dancing away. More lyrics. Brandon Carlile is at his desk looking at his article. He moves to delete it, and it's gone. He shuts down his computer and leaves]
South Park Elementary Gymnasium that still has damage from the Butter's fire. Principal Victoria is going to announce something. Mr. Garrison and Mr. Mackey sit off to one side
To the bathroom?
Wow, this is is pretty nice. [drops trousers and settles in, then begins singing]

What?
Let me see.
How'd you get that on your phone?

Freemium Isn't Free
I'm sorry. I didn't realize I spent that much.
You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
I'll pay you back for it, okay?!
I don't know, I'll figure it out! Jesus Christ!
Ohhh hey guys.
Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best.
Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?
Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. [smiles]
You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?
It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.
It's just...
Yeah, it's fun.
Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.
...Free? [puts his pillow back on the mattress, grabs the phone and starts playing again]
I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.
One?
No, no, it's not.
I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
Okay, I need help. [sometime later Cartman, Kenny and Jimmy arrive, and Stan picks up where he left off. The conversation moves to the living room, and Kyle gives Stan a comforting tap on the right shoulder] There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.
It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
How?
I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? [a bright, fiery light appears behind him and he turns to look at it. Satan emerges from it]
Whoa, shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.
Okay.
So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?
So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
Yeah, no, this is great.
I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?
That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. [Satan taps the screen, stands up, and plays the game]
Ah, Canada?
...Okay. [Satan proceeds to possess Stan] Aaaaahhh!
[with Satan's voice] I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. [continues out the door]
Hey.
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. [turns away and walks off the court]
I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.
We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.
Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. [Marvin takes the dice and rolls them]
Grounded Vindaloop
[holding Butters off] Butters, what the hell are you doing?
Sound pretty typical to me.
Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
Kyle, maybe this is for real.
In on what? [thinks a moment...] Ohh, [slowly] Fuck you!
"Fuck you" what?
Oh fuck you!
No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! [the door opens and Cartman and Kyle walk in]
It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.
No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.
How do you know?
What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
Butters called Customer Service first?
Come on, we're going to Butters' house! [they leave Kenny behind]
Butters.
So now we are in th real world.
Yes, we're here.
[as Stephen chews Butters out, puts some distance between them and himself] Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?
What?! [Stephen unbuckles his belt, Butters holds a hand up]
That doesn't make sense! [Stephen takes his belt off. Butters closes his eyes, knowing what's coming]
Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!! [Stephen disappears, then Butters, then Kyle, then Cartman] You guys? Are you there?
Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. [leaves Butters' room. Stephen and Linda never really left the dining room table/ Stephen senses a change in mood]
Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?
[goes upstairs and enters Cartman's room] Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room.
[thoughtfully looking at the headset] It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck.
Cock Magic
Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls' volleyball. [he, Kenny, and Kyle laugh]
Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.
Shhh!
What's that?
This late?
It was seriously almost hard to watch. [Wendy appears in the distance and walks over to the boys]
[sees Wendy] Wendy, did you hear about last night?
Not that. Did you actually go to that?
Pfft, whatever.
We're men.
Uhhh, Mitchell sent us?
That was freakin' hardcore.
It was just decimation.
Hell yeah! [Kenny lowers his head, and Cartman notices]
What's mean about it?
Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.
Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.
Dad, it's not that big a deal.
Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic.
Do you think they're happy?
Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play "Magic: The Gathering"?
[off-screen] Hey, how about this little guy?
Yeah!
Gee, thanks!
Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.
Dude, girls' volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.
[following the cock Magic fight over the phone] What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
Does an Overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! [meanwhile, the ball goes to #36, who hits it back over the net]
[Randy pushes it gently behind the curtain again, then he squats just long enough to get his pants back up and remove the curtain. Then he hops around. He hops back to the stool and gets some body lotion to lubricate his penis with. Then he pretends to stroke his penis and a bouquet of flowers pops up. He tosses the bouquet into the crowd and a woman catches it]
Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.
A way to finally do something good for other people.

Oh no, what now?

Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!

Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
Alright bitches and hos, via hologram and shit, Michael Jackson! [two men from the Syntech Hologram Company get ready]
Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?
Tell me about it.

This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
Cartman
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,br />All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying. [he walks through the living room, then stops and looks around]
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski, [he looks at the TV and walks up to it]
What brought families together most was a good old TV [he walks through the park with his head down]
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw. [he sees a little girl on a bench looking at her iPhone]
And if you try to complain, you get called a-
Girl
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.
Kyle
[texting] Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
Who did?
That's a little strange, isn't it?
That self-promoting asshole!
Because my dad's an idiot!
Nnnothing, nothing.
We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!
Yeah, you damn kids!
Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!
Because Lorde is my dad, alright?! [walks forward as his anger drains away] Lorde is my dad.
He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
It just all seemed so... stupid.

Hang on. [walks to the kitchen] Dad, did you draw dicks on my friend's face?

Alright, now everyone!

Montage ends, and the camera settles on Mr. Garrison leading a rally at the town square, with his supporters around him.

Tweek x Craig
I just don't get it. I mean, Tweek and Craig aren't gay. Right?
And if it can happen to Tweek and Craig... could it happen to any of us?
I'm confused, Dad. There was this thing at school.
I just don't understand how it's decided.
No, I mean like, what makes the Asians decide who they're gonna make gay?
So you've heard of yaoi?
And so my dad talked to me about it.
And my dad said that Asians have always done this, and they, like, do make people gay.
But why?
Gerald and Sheila meet in front of a painting of Tweek and Craig, and hold hands
Randy brings a bouquet of flowers to Sharon in the kitchen. Craig and Tweek play a video game
At school, heads turn as Craig and Tweek walk through the hallways hand in hand. Next, in Akihabara, Japan, the singer is shown in a karaoke restaurant, singing the lyrics on a video featuring live action of Tweek and Craig

Aaah, he's in charge of the school paper. [points to his right. PC Principal turns left and faces... Jimmy. PC Principal is speechless.] You gonna break his legs, PC Principal?
Truth and Advertising
No, I don't. [Randy lowers his head and looks at his food,]
Dude, Kyle. Will you look at this? [shows him the paper, which has a report on PC Principal sending Jimmy and Leslie on a Disney Cruise]
It doesn't make any sense, dude. PC Principal is using the school paper to cover something up.
You don't wanna get involved? Dude, what's wrong with you?
What's that supposed to mean?
That is not what happened! Something is very wrong here! We all have to stand up to PC Principal together!
You have quotes in here from Jimmy. Did you talk to him?
[the boys look at each other] Come on, we'll get to the bottom of this. [they head out]
I think it was Vermont.
That's an ad for skiing in Vermont.
Just click out of it.
That's a pretty sweet-looking guitar.
Oh that's sweet. Send me the link to that so I can- [a popup ad for Victor Frankenstein appears] Oh dude that new Frankenstein movie is out. I totally wanna see that.
Hit the arrow, I wanna see where it's playing.
Wait wait wait wait wait whoa, whoa. What the hell are we doing?
But what about Jimmy? We were all like totally trying to find out what happened to him.
Wait wait wait wait whoa whoa. What the hell are we doing?
No. That's not what we set out to do.
No, we didn't.
Yeah, like one of us is purposefully trying to keep us from digging too deep because they're afraid.
Why are you looking at me?
Think about it, you guys. From the moment that PC Principal took over Kyle has been different. Haven't you noticed?
He's distracting us, either because he's too afraid or because he- [Kyle arrives with his lunch and sits next to him. Butters is stunned that Kyle showed up]
Kyle, I think it's pretty obvious you don't want us investigating PC Principal.
I don't know.
My dad's stupid, not a bitch! This is about you being scared, Kyle!
Don't you dare call me a Cartman!
Fuck you, Kyle! [delivers a left hook and Kyle falls off the lunch bench]
PC Principal Final Justice
Alright Kyle, what's this about?
How do you know all this?
Kyle!
[gets in his face] You're letting paranoia and suspicion get the better of you! [walks past him, opens the doors, and walks out]
What?
Dad, where were you last night?
Work on what?
Principal Victoria? [the adults take notice] Mr. Garrison? Caitlyn Jenner?
Tell me what's going on, Dad?
[pulls out his gun and aims it at the adults. The adults hold their hands up] No! I wanna know what the hell is going on right now!
Kyle said I couldn't trust you! What are you planning, Dad?
Then what is it?!
I'm gonna go tell Mom!
[runs out of the garage] Mom!
Because you wouldn't talk to me, Dad!
[shifts his aim from Randy to Shelly] She doesn't always take my side!
We all need to be better to each other! [Shelly shifts her aim to Stan, then to Randy, and then to Sharon]
[lowers his gun] We love you too, Dad. [Shelly lowers hers] We just wanna know what's going on with you.
Wait... That's Leslie. [walks away from the table] Oh my God... It's Kyle.
Kyle has been protecting Leslie. They're together. He's been making everyone feel paranoid and saying you're the enemy, Dad.
Yeah!
Fuck you, Kyle! You're the enemy!
So now we know who got Principal Victoria fired!
This is going to be really hard.

Yesterday after school, she wrote one last tweet that said goodbye forever, and then just got off for good.
No dude, she threw her phone in a river. She's... she's gone.
Okay. Can we all agree now, [Stan glares at Cartman] that whoever is doing this, needs to stop?
So tonight, whoever is doing this, isn't going to do it again! 'Cause if he does, we're gonna have to do something about it!
Clyde's right.
What else do we do Kyle? You know better than anybody what a monster he is.
We do it out in the woods. I know how to get him to go.
After school, we're gonna go to my uncle's cabin - in the woods. We're gonna have a slumber party and play Counter-Strike all night with no one around to bother us.
Yeah, but don't tell anyone where you're going. We don't want adults to know cause there's gonna be a ton of junk food.
Everything's fine Cartman. We'll just get there sooner if maybe we don't talk much.
You brought this on yourself, Cartman. We're sorry.
What have we done?
You didn't hear?
The troll, SkankHunt, Kyle. He was all over the internet last night!
It wasn't him Kyle! We took Cartman out for no reason. [Cartman walks past looking down] We can't undo what we've done.
