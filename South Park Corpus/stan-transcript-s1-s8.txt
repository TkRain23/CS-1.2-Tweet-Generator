What's a dildo, Kenny?
Dude, that kicks ass!
Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Dude! Visitors!
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were Visitors!
Visitors are real.
What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?
They took him on their ship.
Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!
Good morning, Miss Crabtree.
Oh, don't worry about him.
Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch.
I said I have a bad itch.
[Turning to see.] Visitors!
Cartman, are those the same Visitors you saw?
Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.
Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce.
[Whispering.] Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.
Dude!
Damn, Cartman!
It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
How can you eat when you're farting fire?
[Gasps.] Where?
Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!
I do not!
Bleech!
[He glances at it.] Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school.
[That gets his attention.] What? How do you know she has a cat?
Stan
Stan
Stan
Stan
Huh?
Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
Whoa!
Killer! Thanks, Chef.
Cartman, interrupting the song with a fiery fart.
Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
A second radio wave reverts him to normal and all is quiet. Dogs bark in the background.
What the hell was that?
Kyle, look! It's them.
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Hey look, [Kenny gets up.] I think Kenny's okay.
Owww.
Wow, poor Kenny.
Dude, Kenny is dead!
See?
Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.
Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. [He hurries away.]
But her note said she'd be here.
Bleech!
Bleech!
Bleech!
Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love?
Don't be such a fraidy-cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
I think we have to signal them somehow.
Come on Cartman, fart!
[To Kyle and Wendy.] He can't hold it in forever.
Hey, it's happening again.
Now, do you believe us, Cartman?
Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.
Yeah.
That was beautiful, dude.
No, they're leaving.
Whoa, dude!
Hey Wendy, what's a fuck? [She shrugs.]
Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with.
Thanks for your help, Wendy.
Hey, I didn't throw up.
Bleech!
Sorry.
Cool.
I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof.
That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.
I don't know what the hell that is...
Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.
I wonder what that thing was that the Visitors gave the cows.
The cows begin hopping about gleefully.
Oh, hey Cartman.
Really, what about?
That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.
	Mr. Garrison's classroom.
Yeah, it was huge.
Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
What were you talking about?
That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rain-forest from a Pop-Tart.
Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
Yeah, that'd be cool.
Crowd goes wild. Judges show all 10's. Little Garrison is shocked.
Bus Stop The kids have gotten off the bus and are going home.
Stan
Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.
Dolphins are way smarter than you!
Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's Eskimos!
Tell me what you wrote about!
Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat Cheesy Poofs, ass-master!
What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.
What's that stuff?
Super fat-ass?
Take that you stupid Indian!
Shut up Cartman!
Wendy moves by Cartman and then whispers to Stan.
Jimbo's Guns. There is a poster welcoming Kathie Lee on the left side of the store entrance.
Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?
Mayor McDaniels
Mayor McDaniels
Quickly taking the mic from him.
love?
Wendy, look!
Mr. Garrison, stop!
Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?
Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?
Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.
We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
Liane
Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?
Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.
Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.
You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.
Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.
Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.
Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.
Is this hunting?
I can't.
I don't wanna shoot the bunny.
I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.
I can shoot you, fat ass!
I'll kill you!
Yeah, Cartman's pee.
Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.
Whatabutt?
Why?
A hook.
Celery?
Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.
Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
Cartman
Next morning. A rooster crows.
What, dude?
Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?
With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?
What?
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!
Yeah.
Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg?
No!
I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
Ah, damn it, I can't do it!
Cartman?
Whoa, he built a wicker basket.
Newscaster
I did it, I did it, I finally killed something.
Hey, that was easy!
What?! Why?!
No.
But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.
Yeah, [He drops his gun.] it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.
	Bus Stop.
Hiya, Sparky.
That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
Good boy, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's your boy? Who's your buddy?
He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
He's not meaner than Sparky.
Sparky'll kick his ass.
That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass!
Sparky! Bad dog!
What?!
What do you mean?
He's just confused.
Sick, shut up dude!
The bus pulls up.
Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. Hut. Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.
Huh?
Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.
Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your- [sees Sparky lunge after Rex] Sparky, get down!
Get down, Sparky! Down!
Um, I'm not really prepared either.
Okay, uh... Asian culture has... plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-
Wow, cool!
Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?
What's a... homosexual?
I guess.
Shut up, dude!
Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?
He just needs some training, that's all. Sit, Sparky.
Good boy, now shake.
Good boy. Now, don't be gay.
Don't be gay, Spark. Don't be gay.
I don't know.
Come on you guys, I have an idea.
Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-
Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!
No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi.
Atta boy, Spark! Get her!
Yes!
Ah crap! Now what do I do?
I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.
Like who?
Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.
Damn it!
I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!
I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin!
Kyle
Kyle
Kyle
Carl
I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.
I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.
I think he might've run away.
I'm not playing.
I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. [leaves]
Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
Sparky! Sparky!
Fine, how are you?
My gay dog ran away and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
Do you have lots of gay dogs here?
Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.
In the huddle. The Cows win the coin toss.
Stan is dancing with a monkey, then sees Sparky.
Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?
I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.
Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.
We can work on making you not gay together.
Sparky?
What don't I understand?
Big Gay Al
Stan
Big Gay Al
His voice cracks and the music stops.
Jimbo
His voice wavers.
Mr. Garrison
Thanks for everything, Big Gay Al!
No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy!
I will Big Gay Al, I will.
I've been getting my best friend back.
Hike!
Mph!
Uh... It- it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
And maybe... we can beat 'em even more next year!
And it's okay to be gay!
Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.
I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.
It's true, I'll show you.
But it was here. It was all right here. There- there was a techno dance club...
Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?
Wow!
Jimbo
Enrique
Cartman
Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.
No!
She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist. She's taking it out on me.
My parents don't even believe that she beats me up. They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!
Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?
Yeah.
Whoa dude! Where'd you get a pet elephant?
Wow, that's cool!
Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.
That'd be cool!
Wait, wait. We still need a pig.
Okay.
[Despondantly.] Yes...
Oh, neither. It's my sister.
Hi Shelly.
Headgear? What headgear?
Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.
No, I think it looks terrific. It matches your AAAAAH!
Go where?
Yeah, quit being such a baby.
At least I'm not a little pig-fucker!
Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
Although, maybe I could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours.
Cartman
Ow!
Yeah! Go away, Pip!
A pig-elephant. Say, now that's not a bad idea.
Kyle
I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
So how do we do that?
Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?
Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?
Shut up Cartman!
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!
Sick dude, she's my sister.
Crap.
No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neck-brace?
Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that... that you're my sister, and I love you.
No. Ahh! Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.
Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig.
The elephant and pig approach each other. Fluffy smiles at the elephant, then turns around in order to receive him.
The boys applaud
Elephant is about to mount Fluffy.
Sick!
Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?
Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.
A big mutant version of me?
I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.
Oh my God!
Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town. We have to find him.
It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.
Stop!
That's good, that's good dude. Just calm down.
Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?
...So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back. When you see Shelly, kick her ass. Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.
No! Shelly bad, you good.
He's tearing up the house, stop him!
Come on Kyle, Cartman.
Mom and dad are home. My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.
You can't just leave me here alone.
Thanks a lot.
It isn't fair! Everybody hates me! The whole town wants me killed! Mom and dad are gonna send me away! I don't want to be sent away! I want to stay here! Eehhhehehe!
Shelly, you, you saved my life. And yet, you've done so much more than that. Today you've taught me the meaning of family. Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.
Uh, ahh, oooh.
Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth. It, it had a baby!
	Stan's House.
Marvin "Grandpa" Marsh
Sharon
It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.
Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?
Aw, dammit!
Heheheh hehehe...
My name's not Billy grandpa, it's Stan.
Sure.
I'm not gonna kill you grandpa.
'Cause, I'll get in trouble.
Leave me alone grandpa.
I'm not going to kill you grandpa!
Good night grandpa.
Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!
Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.
Really??
Wow!
So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?
Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.
Yeah...
Hey Chef.
Bad.
Chef, is it okay to kill your grandpa?
No, I mean, kill my grandpa.
See, I told you dude.
What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
Hi grandpa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.
No grandpa, I'll get in trouble.
No, I can't even kill a deer.
Grandpa!
Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes.
I don't know what to do dude, my grandpa really wants to die.
Hey, yeah!
Jesus?
Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?
Yes?
Goddammit!
What the hell is wrong with everybody?
Kyle, don't be such a butt-hole!
Okay grandpa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.
We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.
Aaah!!
We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...
Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around.
Aww, do I have to?
Hey, what are you doing?!
Uh, I guess.
Okay, you, you can let me out now.
Let me out grandpa!
I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time.
Grandpa turns off the radio and follows.
Eh, grandpa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.
Sure I will grandpa, I will.
Okay grandpa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest. [To Kyle.] You got the cow all tied up?
'Kay, come on guys.
You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.
Are you ready grandpa?
Ok, here we go. Bye grandpa, it was nice knowing you.
What is that?!
Hey, he's coming towards us.
Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!
Yeah, but, mom!
Dad, Death is coming!
Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.
Good point man.
Ahhhh!
[Noticing.] Hey look!
Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.
Whoa!
Come on you guys, let's go home.
What do you mean?
I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.
Cool!
What are you doing grandpa?
That's my silly grandpa.
Comrade 1
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready.
Shut up Kyle!
I'm Raggedy Andy.
Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.
Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
Where'd you get that?
No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fat-ass!
I'll kick your ass, Kyle!
Hey look, Kenny's not dead.
Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?
Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.
I said, "I can't wait to own a fishing tank."
Whoa, dude!
Wendy?
You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?
We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
You what?!
She places a poster of Richard Nixon (aka Tricky Dick) on the door. Two zombies, formerly the mortician and Marty, pass by.
Passer-by
He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.
Oh man, I feel like a total choad.
Hey, where's Kyle?
Whoa, dude!
Yeah, me too.
Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!
I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
I bet I get more candy than you dude.
No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.
Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...
Plastic pumpkin pails...
Taser...
For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.
[Pointedly.] How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?!
I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.
Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!
No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead!
Dude, Kenny!
Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops.
Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!
What are you talking about Chef?
Oh my God, that means...
Wait, where are we going?
I don't know about this Chef.
What are we doing here Chef?
What?
We told you dude.
Hey Chef. Look
Emergency Hotline
Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef?
Wolf howl, then Chef lets loose a howl.
Let's get out of here!
We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.
You call the number Kyle.
We'll hold 'em off.
Sweet!
Wendy?
I know, but uh-... but...
Hey, yeah!
[Apologetically.] Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.
I, I can't.
Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.
Oh man, I can't believe he's gone.
Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.
You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.
Oh, then, what's Halloween about?
Oh.
Yeah.
Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.
Stan
Hey, who's that fat chick?
Oh.
Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
SWEET!
I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number.
Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?
Oh.
Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear.
Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
Just a second fat-ass!
Hello? No, no, it's a ma- [To his friends, confused.] Vas-deferens?
Oh.
Do we get the sports watch right away?
She says we do.
You mean, like Kenny?
Damn.
Dude, that's not a digital sports watch.
Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.
Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?
I think he said his name is Marvin.
Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow.
It was my mom's credit card.
This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.
Yeah, yeah, we do!
He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin.
He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
No.
So why can't he live here now?
This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend.
Hey, where's Cartman?
Dude, the mutant turkeys are back!
Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!
We did it!!
Wow, it sucks he has to leave.
You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.
But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.
Class
Stan steps forth from the choir and heads towards center stage.
Lights, please.
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields,
And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus.
Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?
Stan
Whoa, Christmas snow!
That was sick, dude!
...Nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.
Hey come on guys. We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
We'll catch up with you later, Kyle.
Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?
See you around, dude.
He walks away, then peeks at the mall from behind a tree. Stan is on Santa's lap while Cartman and Kenny wait in line, now forming on Santa's left.
He walks down the road, past a Toy Shoppe and a stand of Christmas trees. The camera pulls back as he walks out of view.
The whole town's pissed off at each other. It's really sweet.
Cartman
Yeah.
Kyle
He leaves 'NOEL' written in poop on the vanity mirror.
Kyle
You guys! I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
What's that?
What's in the box, dude?
[angrily] Dude, sick!!!
Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.
Kyle
The class is clapping along gleefully by now, while Kyle looks at Cartman with ire.
Kyle
Mr. Mackey
Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.
South Park Elementary, the school gym. The MC is on stage.
Kenny reaches the star and makes sure he's safe.
Stan
Cartman
Mr. Garrison
This sucks, dude. This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.
We committed him.
Huh?! O-oh.
This is horrible! Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!
I believe.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Mr. Hankey
Mr. Hankey kisses Kyle.
Mr. Hankey begins tossing presents to everyone.
Mr. Pirrip
Townsfolk
Mr. Hankey, during the second chorus.
You know, I learned something today. I learned that Jewish people are okay. And that...Hanukkah can be cool, too.
Wh-what could it be?
Jesus blows out the candle on his cake and ends up in the dark. He blinks. Credits resume rolling.
Cartman
Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fat-ass, too.
Dark music and changing plays as Damien's eyes show flaming, crackling pupils.
Mr. Garrison
Damien turns to Cartman and concentrates. Cartman's desk suddenly turns over and dumps him onto the floor.
Whoa, dude!
Kyle
Damien
Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want.
Oh great, Green Mega Man it is.
Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?
Hey new kid!
Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.
Kenny trembles for a moment, and then a moment of silence.
What the... ?
A what?
Hey, Chef.
A psychedelic scene appears behind him.
He stands behind a lovely black woman wearing trunks and a big smile.
He floats on a cloud with a lovely white woman, then he's back in the cafeteria
Pip's cap flies off, followed by milk and lunch trays, large tote bags, wall poster, clocks...
Whoa!
Stan, Kyle
Jesus, Jesus!
No no. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.
This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.
Yeah.
[To Kyle.] Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
Red
Jesus
You're gonna fight Satan?
[To Kyle.] I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?
Well, come on. We have to at least see the weigh-in.
Did the Devil show up yet?
Jesus
Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge.
Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'.
Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.
Bubye, Fart-boy.
Hey, Jesus.
Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.
Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs.
But you're his sparring partner, Chef.
Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.
Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid.
Damien taps Pip on the shoulder and the ground opens up.
Pip
Whoa, that was cool!
Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!
Aaanh, he does this all the time.
Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked! [The round ends.] You've got to fight, Jesus.
Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best. [Kyle looks at him.] She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!
Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!
She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
[Turning to Kyle.] What?
[Thinks a moment.] ... Really?
Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.
You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'.
You did, Jesus.
Nah, I saw it on Star Trek.
[Over the microphone.] Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
You're leaving already?
Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
Wendy
I know.
I can't afford a cruise, dude.
Shut up, Cartman!
You can say that again.
Yeu-bluuuch.
I'll kick your ass, Cartman!
Bluuuch.
You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
Yeah, that one!
No.
Sure, Wendy, whatever.
Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight!
(Montage)
(Montage)
Classroom. Ms. Ellen is writing away on the blackboard. The boys are smiling broadly. The camera zooms in on the reason why. Ms. Ellen stops writing, but the boys are still smiling.
Bluuch! I'd love to.
That's not Kyle's...
Stan
[Feigning clearing his throat.] Pf-looser gift, pf-looser gift.
Bluuch.
See? She liked my present the best!
No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
I bet I scored 100!
Oh, hi, Wendy.
That's impossible!
What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?
A whatbian?
Kenny?
No, explain it to us, Chef.
Oh.
Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!
You're just saying that, Cartman.
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?
Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect.
Cartman
I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
No, you're a fatter lesbian than me.
Wow. Hi, Wendy.
Wow!
Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back.
Bluuch. Kick ass!
Are we making love now?
They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.
You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.
But why?
It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?
I think so.
Yup.
Yup.
Did I what?
Oh my God, she killed Kenny!
Stan
Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.
Bluuuuch!
Sorry.
Southwest Colorado, Site B. The kids are on a field trip
Isn't that your job?
Oooh.
Stan
Oh, look, I found another one.
He looks it over.
What is it?
Whoa!
What are you going to do with it, dude?
You did throw it away, Cartman.
Well, you might as well let it go.
Leonard Maltin
I have a button we can use for his nose.
Kyle
Stan
...so?
Like John Elway important?
D'you know John Elway?
Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!
Why do you wanta know, lady?!
Whoa, dude!
It's Saturday.
He backs up and goes out the door. Kyle goes back to sleep. Meanwhile, in Chef's Town and Country, He and Maltin are driving around.
Man, the bus sure is late.
Fine.
Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.
Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on.
Yeah, let us go!
Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.
The boys resume their screaming.
The boys are still screaming.
Whoa, dude!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Assistant
Get us down from here!
Robert Smith? Sweet!
Sergeant
She stops before Leonard Maltin.
Lenardu Marutin shows off some moves. Mecha Streisand respnds by kicking away the ushi bar. Chef and the boys arrive just after that. Lenardu Marutin grabs the building next to the bar and hits her with it, causing her to fall back.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Chef
My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?
Dude! Robert Smith of the Cure!
Mecha Streisand heads for a gas station with a dinosaur for its symbol, but Rabartu Smitu comes up fast behind her. She notices. He shrieks at her, she covers her ears, and skyscrapers all around lose their windows. She responds with her own shrieks, and he covers his ears. More skyscrapers lose their windows.
[Into the walkie.] Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.
[Into the walkie.] Quickly, Robert Smith! She's powerless!
Chef looks at him more annoyed than before. Rabartu Smitu maneuvers Mecha Streisand around and grabs her by the tail. After some airplane spins he launches her into outer space. An electrical overload occurs and she blows up into millions of pieces. The fireworks can be seen from the town and the townspeople cheer up and down.
He did it!
Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!
Good-bye, Robert Smith!
Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?
Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.
Go to hell, Cartman!
Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with.
Yeah.
Oh my God! Look!
Stan
Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him.
We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!
I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.
I always wondered if that would work.
In the backyard?
[Behind the bushes with the others.] Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.
Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
No.
Is that legal?
Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.
I donnow, just keep rolling.
Ms. Cartman and the Chief focus in on each other, then walk to each other, then bump into each other. Ms. Cartman falls, then gets up, vomits, and starts dancing with the Chief.
Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!
Come on Grandpa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.
Aaawww.
This guy sucks!
Cartman? What the hell are you doing dressed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
What??
What are you talking about, Cartman?!
Go ahead, dude.
Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!
Now these two focus in on each other.
Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.
Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
[With the right hand cupped to the side of his mouth.] Shhh! Here comes Cartman.
Cartman?!
Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.
Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny.
Cartman
Liane
Chef
Huh? [Looks up at them.] Oh yeah.
How 'bout some ice cream?
Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!
Man! Cartman's gonna be famous! [Kyle dances gleefully.]
Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.
How's it going, Cartman?
Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?
Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.
Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.
Uh, yyeah.
Uuh, you'll see.
We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money!
Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!
Dude. We lost.
Grandpa!!
Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!
	South Park.
Terrance/Phillip
Small Group
Middling Group
Larger Group
Crowd
Scott peeks out from behind a corner, talking to Saddam on a cell phone.
Celine, Terrance, Bob, Phillip, and people on the field
Large Crowd
A man uses Saddam's head like that of a dummy and provides a falsetto for it. The words scroll across the scoreboard.
The camera pulls away from the stadium, and then from Canada, as if on a plane. More crowds are seen, then some cabins, some mountains, and finally a moose.
The whole scene is now framed in a maple-leaf outline, with the moose in the center grazing. He looks up. When the anthem ends Terrance farts once more and laughs away. His laughter echoes.
	South Park.
Oooh- hey, Kenny.
Could you pull over so I can get out?
I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
Cartman
Cartman tries to resist, but the pull is just too strong.
The car passes a sign for Hell's Pass Hospital.
Cartman is out of breath, breathing heavily, Chef keeps driving.
[Stops.] Ugh. I can't do it, dude. [Kyle and Cartman pass him.]
[Pained.] Oh man. [Grabs his stomach.] I'm gonna be sick.
Oogh.
Ooooogh.
Aghh!
I'm gotta get outta here!
Cartman
Stan
Kyle
Dr. Doctor
Stan
Back at the studio, auditions have ended, Greenfield is looking at the storm.
The boys are in the emergency room with a bunch of patients bleeding, getting nauseous, etc.
Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?
No way, dude!
No.
[Queasily.] Oh boy.
Bleech!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
[To Kyle.] Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?
[The camera pulls back, and back...]
Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!
	South Park Elementary, out front. Garrison and the class stand next to a colorful bus.
[At the next stack.] Hey you guys. Check out these books. [They come over.] Sabrina Unchained.
[To Kyle.] If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?
I don't know. Let's go see.
Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?
Hey, what's this?
Yeah, I wonder what's wrong.
I don't know.
Oh my God, they've killed--
Oh, never mind.
I can't see, dude!
No, we just fake it to shut him up.
Kyle looks looks back at Barbrady.
Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.
Mayor McDaniels walks up with her aides.
Oh, my God! They've killed--
Oh, never mind. [Smiles.]
It's cool, dude. We'll help you.
"If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft".
I.
A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.
Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.
What's it say? What's it say?
I dunno.
Come on, dude, it's not that hard!
Maybe we were wrong about the clue.
Look!
[Gasps.] Oh my God, they've killed--
Goddammit!
Aw, I think that's a mask, dude.
What are you talking about, dude?!
That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.
Cartman!
Hey! So what are you going to do now?
They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.
I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.
	South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom.
[Imitating the counselor] Booooo!
[Mimicking] I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
Why do dogs have cold noses?
Oh.
Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?
Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?
Well, dude, you better find out!
Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
Man! That sucked, getting searched.
No, dude, we never even saw it!
We know, we know, that's what everybody says.
What do ya mean?
Ahhh, bicycles?
Your eyes?
Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.
[Rushing up.] Kyle! You have to stop them!
Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
They're gonna chop off his wee wee!
Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!
Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
Mr. Mackey approaches front door of his house; he places his key into the lock but fails to fit.
What are you goin' to do, dude?
Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.
Dude, what did you make that doll out of?
Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you.
Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Mr. T flies onto him and pins him. Hannibal and Face come and pick him up, then all three rough him up.
Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.
Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!
Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.
Yeah.
[Follows.] Naturally.
You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.
[Mimicking.] Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?
	South Park Elementary Gym.
Yeah.
Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.
If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.
Dammit, we lost one already!
Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup.
We're losing men fast out here!
[Somberly.] No, Cartman. Nobody ever has.
Wa-was it wearing clothes?
Oh, yeah. Eeww.
AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
No! I have to get it out!
ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
[To Cartman.] Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?
Aw, do we have to?
Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
The kids just look at him. He looks back, then turns to Ms. Crabtree.
Whoa, dude, this is a school?
Chef dances, and shows off his butt several times. He also turns to make sure Coach Thomas is watching.
[To Kyle.] Okay, what have you got?
Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!
Places!
Chef, we're hungry.
Scenes from the video:
But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!
Dude, Chef has lost it.
Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese?
Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!
You don't?
Damn, dude. China's fucked up.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Yeah, shut up, Pip. [To Chef.] Can we go home now?
Dude, it's the freak nurse!
Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
	A television is on, and a new show seems to be on the air.
Ned
Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam.
Ned
No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
Whoa!
Wow!
Jesus
"...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp."
"Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster."
"...and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride."
"So was the horror of Vietnam." The end.
From Vietnam veterans.
No, no, we didn't--
Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--
For what, dude?
Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
How?
Well, what do you mean?
Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses.
Yeah.
Ready, you guys?
Okay. Action!
Cut! Cartman!
It's supposed to be a frog!
Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?
Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?
Action!
Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.
Okay, when I yell "action", you start to walk this way, then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.
It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?
Good. A-and action!
Announcer
They deserve it for lying to us, dude.
They're here! Hurry and hide!
Holy crap, dude.
Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!
Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!
We shot all those videos and sent them in.
Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'.
It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!
Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me.
You big piece of crap!
Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!
W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble.
Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!
No, your producer did.
She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.
During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!
W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.
Ms. Crabtree
Hey, Cartman!
Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
Give us some, Cartman!
Dude, the road is always snowy.
Shut up, Cartman!
Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.
Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
Where are we?
I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.
The truck driver sees Ms. Crabtree, then lowers the mirror and sets his hair.
Dude!
Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.
I think we have to signal them somehow.
Come on Cartman, fart!
[To Kyle and Wendy] He can't hold it in forever.
Hey, it's happening again.
It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?
Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass.
Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay.
Now, that was what I call a sticky situation.
Do you see 'er dude?
No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster.
Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.
What time is it?
Dude, I think it's Saturday now.
Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.
I don't know, it's- a big scary monster.
What?
Hey, look!
Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.
Mr. Garrison, stop!
But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.
What was that?
Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!
Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!
Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.
Oh my God, it's killing Kenny!
Hoh boy, we're in big trouble.
Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
What?
We believe in you, Fonz.
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!
Oh no!
Now we need more weight in the back.
No, that's too much!
I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster.
Hey yeah!
Kyle
Kyle is really embarrassed.
The kids laugh at Kyle.
There are twelve adults present: The Marshes, the Broflovskis, the McCormicks, Liane Cartman, Mr. Garrison, Kevin's mother, and three unidentified adults.
Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?
Boy, do I!
John Elway comes over to Cartman.
Cartman, no!
The bus is going over!
[He and Kyle get up and look out the window] Hey! We've landed in ice cream!
GAAA-uh.
Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare.
Dude, I just had the weirdest dream.
Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.
Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.
Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later.
South Park Elementary. In the final hour of the school year...
Shut up, Pip.
Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.
I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.
Jesus, Cartman!
The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
So, we'll have ten M-80s, please.
Heard what?
How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
Oh gosh, killed Kenny!
A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.
Man, it's hot out here.
I know! Let's go sledding!
Come on, Cartman, get on.
What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?
What the hell is going on?
Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.
Stan
Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.
That's good.
Right.
Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
Whatever, dude.
But Cartman, we're trying to--
What does he mean, "living in denial"?
There, how does that look?
Uh, crap..!
He's taking swimming lessons.
Mr. Garrison descends into madness as the song progresses, until he imagines himself going to her studio.
How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?
Yeah, they need to shut it off.
Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
Man, this sucks.
We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
[The phone rings and Chef answers it.] Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what?... A giant snake?... Killing everybody?!... Growing bigger?!... Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, fudge ya. [He hangs up and resumes singing.]
Simultaneous, you and me
South Park. The smoke is heavy in the air. Stan hangs up the phone.
Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
Cartman is all alone in the swimming pool.
Cartman
How many days left in summer?
Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
There's nothin' to do.
Hey, look! We blew up the snake!
Winter's back!
Well, I can hardly wait.
Hey, Chef!
Sundance Film Festival. A small Western town. Bustling sounds are heard as the camera slowly pans down. A crowd streams by in the background behind a sports car and limo, and front and center are Robert Redford and a woman.
Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.
Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.
She's not my girlfriend.
Damn, dude. Look at all these people.
Whatcha doin'?
Calm down, tubby.
Shut up, Cartman! [To Wendy.] Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. [They walk away.]
When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
They what?!
[With soda and popcorn.] Oh, brother.
Dude!
Dude!
Sheila
Mr. Hankey
Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!
Yeah, pretty much.
The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.
Dude, now that'd be like IMAX.
Are they good?
Hey, dude, these are good!
There is what again?
Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?
To the sewer, dude.
The boys are now in the sewer with flashlights in hand. A rat clamors up a pipe and out of view. Spiderwebs are everywhere.
What was that?
Mr. Garrison?
What do you mean?
Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?
Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.
Jeez, they made that into a movie already?
[Happening upon the scene.] Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!
If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!
So what do we do now?
Why?
Kyle
[Concerned.] Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.
Okay!
Sorry.
Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!
Blaach!
No problem, dude.
What the hell is he doing?
Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you.
Hell's Pass Hospital. Sharon and Dr. Doctor stand before Shelly's bed.
Dude, you've got herpes on your face!
Ow!
Yeah, it's pretty weird.
Stan knocks on the door and Stuart McCormick answers, beer in hand.
We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
Catch what?
Stuart sits in his armchair.
Sshh! Cartman!
Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!
Huh?
Dude, I think I just saw a rat!
I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
Oh.
[Mad.] Goody? What do you mean, "goody"?!
Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.
Well, you sure seem happy about it!
Okay.
Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha. [Click.]
No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day--
Ey! Get me out of here!
Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!
That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.
Wait! Where are you going?
Milkshakes?!
Weak!
And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
[Pointing to Shelly.] Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
They did?
Why?
[Long gasp.] Of course!
Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!
It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
Gerald
How does someone get herpes?
But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. [Coughs.]
And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.
Thanks a lot, Frida!
[Hiding behind Kyle.] I don't wanna go back there.
Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
You know, freshen up your breath.
Pretty good.
Wow, coo-hul!
We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods
Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.
It's boring.
Cartman is singing along by the end of the first line.
Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?
This is stupid.
Announcer
Announcer
Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium.
I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
Yeah, mine too.
Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!
Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!
That's a haiku?
Oh.
No.
Mr. Garrison
The class roars with laughter.
Yeah. What's a discharge?
Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.
[Stumped, then to Kyle.] Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?
Where have you been, Cartman?
Cartman
Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
Mr. Garrison
Over in Nurse Gollum's office, Van Gelder is still strapped down. Mr. Mackey stops by.
Dude, what just happened?
Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.
Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
Dude, this isn't right.
We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.
Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there.
Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.
He hits this switch-
Yeah, I guess so.
I don't know.
This says "maximum."
Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!
Dude, I told you something was up with this place!
He finishes with a flourish and a bow.
She works hard for the money
He rips off his jacket and reveals a sky blue sequined vest and bowtie - and his belly button. The judges are surprised.
She works hard for the money
He moonwalks, then faces the judges again. End of performance.
...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.
Yeah, pretty sure.
What other crime in South Park?
Liane
Director
Director
Oh, no! They got Chef, too!
Why are you doing this, dude?
Cheesy Poof Cartman
Mr. Mackey!
Mr. Mackey
Get over here and untie us!
Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
Clubhouses
Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.
Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.
American base is only a few feet away.
Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!
No, you don't!
Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself!
Huh-I dunno.
Hi, Wendy.
...No.
We could?
But dude, I don't have a clubhouse.
Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
[Intrigued.] Truth or Dare? Wow.
Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help.
Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.
How do we do it?
Yeah, dude! How'd you know?
Dude!
Sweet!
This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.
Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?
Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
We're building a clubhouse.
Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!
Fine!
Fine!
Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
'Kay.
But Mr. Twig sucks.
Better than yours, fat boy.
Almost.
Yes, Mr. Garrison.
Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.
Phew.
No, I just--
I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
But I didn't write the note!
Shut up, Cartman!
Oh, man.
Dear Kyle.
The entire class stares at Stan in shock.
Whoa, dude!
What's 'skylarkings'?
Who?
Oh, no.
It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.
Excuse me.
Hello?
I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow!
My mom won't let us.
Pretty good. We're almost done.
We're going as fast as we can!
Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.
No.
I didn't even think about that.
And I say, "Dare!"
"Truth?" But that's boring! I want to get "Dare" to kiss her.
Oooh.
Yeah.
"Dare!"
Oooh.
You really think so?
Wow!
Hello?
We're working on it.
No, you don't!
Dude!
Aw, that hunk of fat-- [Sharon walks in.] Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?
What?! Why?
Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?
...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!
What?!
This is happening way too fast.
Okay. We're done.
It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls.
G'oh?
Go where?
But no! I have to get the girls to come-
Weak!
Dad?
But I don't understand why we have to--
Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?
But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?
You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.
What? That's it?
I guess, but--
Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.
No way, dude! Don't be silly.
We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right?
Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.
To say "Dare," dumbass! Jeez.
Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?
Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.
[To Kyle, softly.] Remember, "Truth" the first couple of times.
Dude!
Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.
Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?
[Sensually.] Dare.
...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!
Crap!
Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
What?
My dad lets me watch cartoons.
Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!
Oh.
Divorce is stupid.
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy.
Wow. Clubhouses are magical.
Dare.
...What?!
Cow Days
Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
Really?
Cartman
What's that?
What the hell was that?
Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
Yeah, this line is way too long!
Here we go.
Kyle
What ride?
My ass we will!
Yeah, let's not ride that ride again.
We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
Sorry, Officer Buttbaby.
Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?
This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
[To Cartman.] He really wants those dolls.
Alright, this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go.
How long was that?
Damn it!
That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
What are you going to do?
Oh, yeah. That's a good idea.
Hold on, Cartman!
Come on, Cartman.
You okay, dude?
Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?
What's the matter with him.
But can he still ride a bull?
Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?
Stan
Oh, he's fine, dude.
Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.
How's he doing?
Do you think he can ride the bull?
Cool.
Jesus, dude!
Oh, hell!
Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.
Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!
[Points to him.] There he is!
Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!
Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this.
I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
Dude, that bull's gonna kill him.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
We did it, dude, we did it!
Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.
Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden?
We should-
Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs!
[With a Terrance doll.] Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh.
Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?
Oh-h. Nowhere.
Chef Aid
Kyle
Mr. Garrison
Mr. Garrison
Mr. Garrison
But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
Mr. Garrison
Chef
What, dude?
Chef
A clattering noise is heard.
That's what Cochran used in the O.J. Simpson trial.
Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.
Hello there, Chef.
Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.
Chef
You do?
Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.
We've gotta help him, dude.
Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass.
Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
Wow, you remember him?
Man
So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?
[Unsure.] 'Kay.
Thanks, dude.
Hello, are you Meat Loaf?
Our friend, Chef.
Wow! So you'll help him?
Yeah, thanks. [To Kyle as they walk away.] That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!
Wait! Wait! What are you doing?
No, you don't!
You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!
No more Chef.
We can't let him down, you guys.
Dude, it's over. He's gone.
No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
It's easy, dude. Chef Aid.
Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.
A couple approaches the stand, bewildered.
The couple leave.
Kyle
[To Kyle.] Cartman just needs to put more into it. [To Cartman] Dance better, Cartman!
A white limousine pulls up.
Elton John! What are you doing here?
Boy, do we!
Yeah, dude, it's all yours.
The five people in the audience immediately jump up and down very rapidly.
Lots of people start purchasing tickets.
South Park Police Dept. A short while later.
Teen MC
Mr. Garrison and Chef pull up.
Chef exits, surprised.
Chef
Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?
We’re gonna raise your money, Chef.
Mr. Big Record Producer is still sawing.
Ozzy picks up Kenny and bites into his head.
Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!
Out in the crowd, Mr. Garrison has both Mr. Hat, and Mr. Twig.
Wendy smiles and looks over at Stan, who smiles back.
Kyle
Spookyfish
I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
What?
Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
Dude, this is creepy.
Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo!
Wow!
I don't know.
I don't like it. It's spooky.
Do I have to?
Damn it!
Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor.
Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?
Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
Why do you keep saying "hella", fatass?!
Can you leave the light on, Dad?
I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
Where did it go? [he lifts the covers and looks under the bed, then sits back. The fish swims back into view.] Huhhh. [he gets out, picks up his shirt, and throws it over the tank. He goes back to bed and looks at the tank again.]
Hey. Where did the shirt go? [hops off and approaches the fish] I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?! [the fish blinks, then looks down and to the right. Stan's eyes follow, and he sees the shirt.] AAAaAaAaAa [runs back to his bed and pulls the covers up, then drops them a bit. He looks at the fish] I'm not gonna look. [shuts his eyes, then opens them again. The fish tank, and the dresser it's on, are closer to the bed] It's not closer. I'm just seeing things. [shuts his eyes again, then opens them. The tank and dresser are at the foot of his bed] GAAAH! [shuts his eyes tight, and opens them one more time. The fish tank is now on the bed, between his feet] AAAAAAAH!! [he jumps off, runs to his door, and rushes into the hallway] MOM! Mom! [comes back to the room with her in tow]
Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!
No!
AAAAAAAAH! [runs back to bed]
[pointing] The fish! [nothing is left of the writing on the tank wall] But-
[gasps. A man lies dead between the tank and the bed] WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!
Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-
[turns to the fish] You're not gonna get away with this! [the fish writes again, blows, and the message is: "Yes I Will."]
[sees Sharon pass by] Mom, what are you doing?
Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next!
But MOM!
'[8 a.m., next day. A rooster crows and Stan's clock farts. Stan wakes up and looks at the tank. The fish is still there. Stan hops off the bed and walks to the tank, but is stopped by another body.]'
MMOOMM!
[points at the body, then holds up his hands] No, mom!
[squeezes into Kyle's chair so both fit. Cartman walks to Kenny's chair] I haven't been sleeping so well.
Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
You guys are my best friends
I love you guys. [throughout the song, Kyle and Stan look on with awe]
I haven't been sleeping well.
My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
What are you doing?!
Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
What?
Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
[taps Kyle, then softly] Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.
Cartman!
Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
Do you remember what pet store?
Where?
That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
Just help me take it back. Come on! [walks to Aunt Flo, who's now dead on the floor] Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!
It was the fish! [points to it]
Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. [Kenny starts to gargle as the fish gives him the blender treatment. The water turns blood red as Kenny spins in the tank]
[to Kyle] Come on, we're running out of time. [both walk by Randy trying to open a door]
Cartman's house. Both Cartmans are seated on the sofa. Evil Cartman has the phone book, Cartman has a pot pie.
Yeah, my goldfish-.
I know.
Come on, let's go! [takes the fish with him and stops before Sharon] Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!
I wanna return a fish.
Yeah, dude.
So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
Why?
Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.
I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman! [the clerk takes the fish from Stan]
Yeah!
I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.
[the crowd cheers] We won, dude!
Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! [the two groups face each other]
Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
[picks it up] Get to the stage! [Stan, Kyle, and Evil Cartman rush up. Stan's spooky fish attacks a man and kills him]
Up yours, evil twin! [zaps him back to the evil, parallel universe.]
Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. [takes aim]
Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!
Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
You tricked us, Cartman!
Kyle
Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!
But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!
But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
I don't want your lame-ass supper!
[retrieving a backpack from his closet] Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old! [goes to his window, opens it, and stands on the sill] I don't need this stupid family anyway! [drops to the ground outside and leaves]
[walking up] Okay, let's go!
'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry!
So, how far is it to Nebraska?
Yeah. Or, we could not.
4 HOURS LATER.
Kyle
Cartman
This is Nebraska?
[now seated] Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?
Later... Cartman's Grandma's house. Cartman's singing is heard approaching.
[pointing] He's the fat one.
Sick, dude.
[dissenting] Yeah, right!
My family's dead! [Uncle Stinky, a baby, and Aunt Lisa gasp.]
They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
[to Cartman] Dude, is he here every year like this?
Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.
What, dude? [Cartman wakes up]
Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.
What was that?
I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. [Kyle walks behind Stan and punches Cartman]
We thought you were in jail.
[snaps his fingers] Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.
All families suck ass!
Do you really think we should go with this guy?
Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
I really like that guy.
Lollyland. a mall worker dressed as a Hankey elf, covered in Hankey kisses, approaches the boys.
[after a pause] Mr. Hankey? [his elves lift the boys onto Hankey's lap]
You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
Oh, boy. You've done it now.
Manson
Where did you go, Uncle Charlie?
Hey. Where's Kenny?
Oh, hey Kenny.
There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
Oh ooh.
[from inside the house] ...Sorry.
[walks to the window, looks out, sees his parents, then turns to Kyle] Dude, they're gonna kill me.
[walking in] 'Scuse me. I wanna go with you.
Please, I don't wanna go back with them.
I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.
What?!
But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.
[pondering] I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks. [they hug]
Everyone Else:
Chief Stevens:
I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.
Really?
Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?
Stan
Gnomes
That's okay with us.
[laments] Oh, not Tweek.
Dude, we can't work with this kid.
No.
Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--
Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about.
Great. A lot of help you are, kid.
What?
What gnomes?
Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes.
Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.
'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
[to Tweek] Wow, that sucks, dude.
Yeah.
Kind of bitter.
Aooooo!
Yeess, this stuff rocks!
[running] Whoopee!
Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.
[cross] Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!
Bad!
[goes with Kyle to get it] No, we'll use it.
Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!
Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
Huh??
Our case?
Uh... Hooray.
Uh...
[rising from the bottom] I like small businesses.
Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!
'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!
["Yum tum yummy tum day!"] Yeah, that makes sense.
How do we stretch that into five minutes?
What the hell? ["We won't stop"]
Hey there, little guy.
Hey, he talks!
Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?
Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?
Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?
Damn, dude, this place is huge!
I don't get it.
No you don't, fatass!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.
Do you know anything about corporate takeovers?
Underpants?
Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.
Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay!

Holy crap. dude!
This guy rules!
Yeah!
Dude!
Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!
Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
[to Cartman] Hey, he's still alive. [looks down and calls] Kyle, you okay? [Cartman returns and looks down]
Can you climb back up, dude?
Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach! [his vomit goes everywhere] Bluchluchluchluch.
Sorry. [Cartman slips a bit] What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! [drops to the cave ground and stands up]
All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this?
He's like, some frozen guy.
Shut up, Cartman! [to Kyle] Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.
[to Cartman and Kenny] You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!
[to Kyle] Help me chip some of the ice away.
Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?
Where shall we bring it?
I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
[stops] Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? [Cartman pulls, but isn't going anywhere]
You didn't find him, I found him.
You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
Huh, excuse me?
I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
Really.
Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!
Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.
No, it isn't!
I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!
No, I'll go! I found him!
Oh my God, they revived Gorak.
Uh, hi.
He said, "hi."
He wants to know where he is.
You're... home.
Dude, you've been frozen 32 months.
Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him.
Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!
Fine! [turns and walks away]
He doesn't look very happy in there.
I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!
[approaches with Kyle and Cartman] You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
Let him out, dude. He's scared.
[gasps] Oh my God, they killed Kenny! [looks at Kyle]
[a voice in the night] Gorak! [he rushes to the habitat, then heads to the access door] Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?
I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.
What are you doing here?
What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
His name is Gorak!
Gorak!
What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!
[looks up at Larry, who looks back] No he doesn't!!
I found him, I'm rescuing him!
You're a dick!
You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!
Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!
[hushed] Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.
I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean. [turns his head aside] Wait. [walks off in the opposite direction]
Larry
Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!
You suck as a best friend, Cartman!
[walks to Larry, bathing in a tub out in the open with the garden hose, and looks at him for a while] What are you doing, Gorak!
Wow, that sucks, dude.
What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!
Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!
Come on! [the three run away]
We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.
My friend, Gorak!
No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!
Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock.
'K.
O-okay.
'K [puts up his fists]
[punched by Kyle] Ow!
Watch my coat, dude.
Huh? [both look at Larry]
[panting] No problem, Gorak.
Yup.
[panting] Right on.
His... name... is... Gorak!
They're after you!
[catching up] Where's Gorak??
[turns around] Wait, look! The helicopter!
He's alive!
Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.
[walks off with Kyle] Could we be best friends again? [Cartman stops] I hate having Cartman as a best friend.

It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
What?!
But we don't even care about the rainforest.
[As Sharon drags him to the bus] Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!
Nooo-ho! [The door closes and the bus pulls away. Stan and Kyle look out the back window in dismay]

No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.
Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. [Camera closes in on a stunned Kyle]
[sees a branch] Aaah! Snake!
Oh. [sees it again] Aaah! Snake!
Oh.
AAAAAAA! [hides behind a girl]
SNAAAKE! [all see and gasp]
AAAAAAA! [runs farther back]
[lifts some away] I'm just a-scared of snakes.
Dude!
Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!
I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.
This doesn't look very safe.
Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.
Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke? [a column of smoke is seen floating above the canopy]
Holy crap! [all run]
Jesus Christ!
We're sinking.
All we ever heard growing up was, "Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile"!
Oh, now she figures it out.

[with an air pump] Is this what you're looking for, Kyle?
Why is that funny?
That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
He just... ignited.
Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.
Wow, that was short. [Priest Maxi stops them as they leave the pew]
The what?
I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible.
Dad, where's our Bible?
Or else what?
...What?
[after a long pause] Where's our Bible?
Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?
...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. [the boys go up the stairs and exit]
Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.
Come on, Randy. You said we were gonna drink beer and watch the fight.
Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.
And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. [this is not part of the Stations]
Mayor McDaniels
Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. [Kyle has tied Cartman to it]
[produces a crown of thorns] Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, "Thanks."
Cartman
This spot looks good. [they drop the foot of the cross into the spot and lift the rest of the cross upright, then leave]
Okay, cool. See you, Cartman.
Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess.
Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.
Whoa, dude, my dad's famous.
Wow, he died.
Cartman??
Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus.
Sick, dude!
Okay, okay, just go away! [Mr. Mackey leaves laughing, and the boys walk on]
Uh. We've been taking care of him.
Apples?
Dude!
I don't think I like this new law.
Yeah.
And the Nobel Prize goes to: [opens the envelope] Randy Marsh, for the theory of spontaneous fart things. [the audience applauds wildly]
Mephesto
Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!
Dude, he's still not dead.
That's not your mom calling!
He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.
Hey, yeah! [they turn and walk away]
City Hall. The Mayor and her aides are in shorts and T's.
Dad, where's the phone book?
Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?
Oh.
Uh, it... sucks ass.
Oh my God, what's going on?
Dude, that's my dad!
I know, huh?
He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.
What are you doing, dad?
No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!
Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!
Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.
See, at first, Jesus was all like, "Why me?" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying, [performs a Vulcan greeting] he raised his hand and said, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. [Randy returns to his work]
Huh?
Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?
Stan
Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!
[to Kyle] See? My dad is the coolest after all.
Cartman!
He's been up there for like, three weeks.
That's amazing!
Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?
The Succubus
Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.
[squints hard for a better look] Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman? [Kyle blinks hard]
Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
Where's Chef?
Why did Chef quit?
[after a moment of silence] Could you just hand us some food please?
Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.
Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.
But why? Why would you quit?
So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
Talked?!
[ignoring that statement] That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!
What the hell is going on?!
Chef
Chef, Veronica
Kyle
]
She's stealing Chef from us.
Wait you guys. [pensive] Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? [the others think about it...]
...Yeah, screw that bitch.
Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
We wanna talk to Chef.
And a chef hat.
Huh?
Chef, you have to dump the bitch!
But we don't like her.
I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.
[pissed] Dude! He bailed on us!
Come on! We're going to his house! [they leave the bus stop]
[sarcastic] You forgot!
Oh no! No nononononono!
Chef
[the boys are truly shocked] We have a chance to find the sunshine.
South Park Elementary, Mr. Garrison's class
Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.
What's a succubus?
Yeah!
Wow, you are smart, Mr. Garrison!
Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him. [a small station wagon pulls up, driven by Cartman's mom]
Who are you?
Chef, we have to talk to you!
You're Chef's parents?
No, that's okay.
He wanted money?
Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?
[disappointed] Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman.
Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.
We know what you are, lady!
A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!
I guess.
Jesus dude! [the boys are trembling, and Kenny keeps that hood tight]
Excuse me! [the boys stop at the register] We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news. [the boys approach the head table]
Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him
Chef, but-
No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!
Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.
Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.
What the hell does that mean?
Right.
Yeah?
Oh-hoho!
Cartman
We've got to find our way together...
Stan
We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song. [turns to Cartman] You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? [taps him]
God-damnit! You can't fall asleep.
There she is! ["Here Comes the Bride" plays. Chef and Priest Maxi await her.]
[as Veronica walks by] Bitch. Bitch.
Bitch.
[to Cartman] All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.
[as "A Morning After" begins] Here it goes.
Now, Cartman! [Kyle holds the needle in his left hand. The crowd gasps and Veronica is pissed]
Light the for looking on keep let's

Veronica
night-
Veronica
Come on Cartman!
Oh my God! She killed Kenny!
Mr. Garrison
[walks up with Kyle to Chef] We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!
[cheerfully] We'd love them!
Mr. Garrison

Come on, you guys know the words.
Kyle
Where are you going?
So? You can poo in the wilderness.
Not here! Go further away!
Sick, dude!
Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves? [a yellow creature peeks out between the trees. It is the one looking at Cartman's rear.]
Kenny
[thinking of poo] We don't wanna look at it, Cartman!
I see it!
[outside] I saw it this way!
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!
I think his name is Junjun.
Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends?
Wow!
[put off] No, he's annoying.
Why don't we just tell our parents?
[softly] Sshh! Be quiet. We could get in big trouble for being here.
[softly, curtly] Sh! Keep quiet, stupid!
Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?
God-damn!
[to Kyle] Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?
[to Kyle] Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
Dude, it's crowded in here.
Jakovasaurs
School, school! I like school!
Kyle
Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!
Oh, he'll win. Don't worry.
[huffs] Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.
Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.
Tweek vs. Craig
[quickly points] Tweek is!
Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls.
I don't know. He's such a wuss.
No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
How much?
You're on!
Hey Tweek.
Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?
He's really got it out for you, dude.
Super. See you there. [they walk away, pleased]
Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler!
The bell rang. Can we go?
Come on, you guys. [Kyle and Cartman follow him out.]
This is gonna be so sweet, dude.
You're on, fatass! [Kenny shows up]
How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?
Aw, hell!
Tweek?
How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!
Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, "Man, Tweek's a wuss," and we were all like, "No he's not, Craig," and he was all like, "Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"
Yeah, it was weak.
Tomorrow?
Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.
Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed. [the two groups meet] All right. Here we go.
Well?
Huh?
[in disgust] Aw, dude, come on!!
[approaches the fighters] All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight.
All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!
Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!
Damn it!
Okay, the time has finally come. [the other kids close in]
You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
[he leaves the desk and goes to the table saw, turns on the switch, lies on the table feet first, and is pulled towards the blade]
Mr. Adler
Ye-hah!
Come on, Tweek! You got him!
Yeah.
Here they are.
Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. [trading punches]
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig.
Hey, you guys. How are you feeling?
Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you.
So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. [the group turns towards the door]
[the group turns back to the beds] Well, I mean, that's what was on the news.
Come on, Tweek! You got him!
Sexual Harassment Panda
[song and dance]
Hi, boys and girls. [the class says nothing]
Mr. Garrison
Ohh, dude, get me out of here!
You would think that, you little ass-sucker.
An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.
What?
No you can't, you little ass-sucker!
Hoh, whatever! [rests his head on his left hand]
I called you an ass-sucker!
What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!
Wwhat do you mean?
Uh... I'm eight?
Huh?
I have to give him half my stuff?
Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy.
Uh, no! I hate that toy!
Damnit!
Gerald
It's time to celebrate, yeah
Broflovski residence. It is literally bigger now - 50% taller, wider, deeper... Same with the garage, itself bigger than the house to it's right. The icicles are also bigger. Furniture movers come by with new furnishings for the new, big house. Two delivery men take a big-screen TV into the house
Where's our desks?
[huffs] You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?
South Park School Board meeting at South Park Elementary
Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Mr. Evans
Bad.
Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?
Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!
[enter with Kyle, Cartman, Kenny] 'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please.
We want Sexual Harassment Panda.
Well, where is he?!
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
Still, there don't seem to be no end in sight...
Barkeep
Standing Patron
[enters] 'Scuse me.
Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.
...Coats?
Dude, what the hell is going in?!
Well, we don't take kindly to you!
Come on, we'd better hurry. [the boys make their way past the men and leave]
[reads] "Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune". This must be the place. [they enter]
Whoa! Who are you?
...Thanks a lot, dude.
Have you seen any panda bears?
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Stan
Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other.
[to Petey] Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again.
[faces the audience] No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say.

Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub
I don't want to go to this stupid party!
No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels.
Awww!
I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
[soft but urgent, tugging at Randy's pants] Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!
[soft but urgent, tugging at Sharon's dress] No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!
Shut up, Pip.
Butters, is there any way out of here?
Oh my God.
No.
[looks back] Yes.
[incredulous] Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me.
Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!
[looks back displeased] What?
[grudgingly] What do I have to do?
Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.
[in no mood for role-playing] What, Pip?
What the hell do you want?!
You did? [rises and walks to the way]
We're going upstairs.
Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! [crawls into the duct]
[mischief flashing across his face] Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set.
I don't care, just hurry! [the Angels walk away]
Rad! [hops on the bed and starts switching channels]
There are no more missions. I have everything I want. [four shows and a commercial pass by as he channel-surfs.]
[annoyed] Just... play something else! God!
Whoa, cool!
[as the reporter speaks] Wait a minute [hops off the bed and walks towards the window. He looks out and sees the ATF] Oh my God! [runs back to the others] Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!
[rushes out with the others in tow] Hey you guys! We've got a big problem! [sees everyone quite drunk. A naked man dances by with a lampshade on his head] The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. [the adults didn't hear him]
[sees his mom waddle by] Mom, go look outside.
Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. [walks to the door. The others follow]
We don't have any weapons.
Get back inside! [opens the door and the boys hurry in]
[rushes up with the other boys] Dad! Dad, they shot at us.
Mom!
[slaps Butters across the face with a backhand and grabs him by the collar] Get a hold of yourself, man!
Come on. We have to find out what's happening. [leads the other boys to the bedroom]
Sh!
We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. [walks off]
Tell them not to burn us down.
[removing the tape from the camera] Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.
You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. [Dougie smiles]
Oh no, we're out of time! [hops down and moves away. He ties some rope around Butters' middle] Are you sure you can do this, Butters?
We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. [hands him the video]
Can you hit a target, Pip?
Hit something nice and solid now. [Pip releases the plunger, with rope attached, and it lands on the left side of Barbrady's head. Barbrady moves just a bit, then sips his coffee]
Nice job, Pip.
Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn. [he and Dougie help Butters onto the window sill and hook him up to the rope]
He made it down. [Pip and Dougie grin]
But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.
You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
Super weak.

Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery
This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt. [turns and walks away with Kyle and Kenny]
Christmas?
W-we weren't scared!
That's just an old legend.
I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!
Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.
Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! [all turn left and walk off. As they walk towards the shore, they pass a shack. After they pass, three pirate ghosts peek out from behind the shack, scowling]
[walks up with Kyle and Kenny] Come on, fatass, we have to go!
Yes you can, porky. [Liane giggles again]
Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.
What's the scariest thing we could get?
No! [turns, then says gravely] A dead body.
We could never make one that looks real enough. [his voice lowers] To be really scary, it would have to be real.
[voice low] We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.
[appeasing] Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?
All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,
Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.
Stan
Well, let's dig 'er up! [walks to the grave and jabs his shovel in]
Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!
Yes you do! Now, dig! [all four begin to dig]
Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three! [they pry the door open, and then jump back and peer in] Whoa, dude.
[chuckling] Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh.
Okay, grab the sled. [Kenny goes and pulls it up. The others stand aside. When the sled abuts the casket, Cartman pulls at the corpse with his shovel, and it falls forward onto the sled]
Stan
Who was that?
Dude, not cool. This is scary. [Some rustling, and a member of KoRn shows up]
Hay, you're that band KoRn.
What are you guys doing out here?
Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.
Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
[points to it] Yeah, dude. It's right over there.
Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. [Cartman hides the body behind the boxes]
Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! [they start walking away]
[a cowboy sheriff in white] Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. [Kyle is a clown in a yellow jacket]
Where's your costume, fatass?
Hey, Kenny.
[rushes his friends along] Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma! [Cartman goes for the sled] This is gonna be sweet
What's the problem?
She has to be here! [Kenny meanders]
We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.
Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.
How should we split up?
This place gives me the creeps.
We've got to hide!
Ow!
There she is!
Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back! [the cutout shakes and falls away, revealing Nibblet]
Boo!

Hey, fat ass.
Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe.
What are these? They're Chinpokomon!
Yeah, like ancient history.
No, dude!
Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.
The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
[exasperated] Ogh..!
Yeah, get with the times, dude. [turns and walks away with Cartman and Kenny]
Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?
Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!
Stan
What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. [moves Kenny so the glazed eyes can be seen]
Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
You didn't know that?
Dude, did you just say "a-ight"?
Yeah, dude. Nobody says "a-ight" anymore.

Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. [walks away]
Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?
[flatly] Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore.
No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.
...Ye-eah.
Oh... Wait. [walks with the plane] Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.
Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?
What the..? [Kenny's body rips open and a bunch of rats crawl out of him.]

We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
What's that?
Stan
You shut up, [backhand slap] gaywad!
No, we're friends.
What?
Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos.
Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground.
You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass.
Come on, Pip, say it. Say "Please, hit me."
No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say "Please, hit me," I won't hit you.
All right. [backhand slap]
Alright, we'll try this again, Pip.
Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. [moves out of the way as Craig and Butters position the ball]

[tsk] Aw, man, if you have to.
Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. [laughs]
Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff.
Ah, dude, you don't say that.
Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?
Well, get your ass out of bed! [Kenny walks off] We have to go deal with that home-school kid!
But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!
Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!
[sees Kyle enter and walks to him] Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? [with him are Craig, Butters, and Cartman.]
Oh, brother! [shows his displeasure to the others]
You suck now, Kyle! [walks away with the other boys]

Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!
Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark. [Butters walks up]
Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? [Craig walks up]

We're on like, some foreign planet.
Uh, thanks.
U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.
Cool!
Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!
[Cartman looks in pleasant wonder] Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here.
Uuh. Thanks.
Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.
What??
Oh. [the cargo door closes and Marvin is ready to take off]
Run for it!
He's not done for, he's standing right there.
Alright, we made it!
They're shooting at us.

Hoohoo what a dumbass!
It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.
Cartman, you can't do that!
Run for your life, dude! [the boys run off. Cartman watches from the hill as the battle rages on]
Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!
Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.
Oh here comes the bus. [a tourist bus. Butters is behind the doors waiting to come out. The doors open and Butters exits. The bus leaves] Butters? Are you the only one that came back?
What battlefield?!
[crumples the message into a ball and throws it away] God dammit, that fat piece of shit!
That would suck so much ass.
I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?
Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.
[now in town] Dad, Dad. [Randy appears and stops] Mom wants you to come home.
Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home.
Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.
[rushes up with Kyle and Grandpa] Haha! You lose, fatass!
Where are you going?
[reaches the scene a bit late] Oh, no.
[takes the bullhorn] Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here.
No, you can't do that. Our dads are there.
Aw, dammit!
Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.
Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?
Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy.
Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.
[walks over with Kyle] It's finally over, Cartman. You lost!
Don't touch me. [Clinton stands up]
Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-
Awwww!
Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home. [he and Kyle walk away with Grandpa] Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!

Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus
Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome.
No you didn't!
How do you know?
You're making that up! [a woman steps out of a small building, and he addresses her] Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?
Please, it's important.
Dude, Cartman can't hit puberty before us.
Hello?
No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.
Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.
Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.
So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?
[frightened] You did?
Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan [He sets his pencil down and goes to bed]
Dammit! Dammit dammit dammit!
[sobbing] I'm not bleeding out my aahass!
No it's not! It's terrible! [Sharon looks worried. Stan returns to his bed and prays] Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.
Crowd
The Ewok Village 2000. Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny sit in a circle with candles next to them.
[despondent] Hey, Chef.
Bad.
Can I come in?
Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.
No.
Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't.
Yeah, Cartman told us.
Okay.
Stan
But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it! [hops off and heads out the door.]
But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad.
No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself.
So do you know anything that can help him?
Hormones? [smiles. Mephesto takes him to the medicine cabinet]
Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best! [walks away with the bottle]
The Ewok Village 2000, next day. Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny have reassembled.
[outside, below] Hey assholes! [the three rise and head for a window]
[now with some facial hair] Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!
So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
[voice breaking] Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones. [walks away. The other three withdraw and resume their discussion]
Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs.
[walks up, with a deep boy voice] Have I missed anything?
No. I didn't, but-
[goes onstage] Jesus, why does God hate me?
He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.
Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?
What do you mean?
I just wanted my period.
I have it. I have the question. [steps forth] Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?! [the crowd stands aghast]
Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before! [people look at him, annoyed] Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay. [looks around] I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?

Who's Karen Carpenter?
Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. [the other students turn to see the fight]
We're not rednecks!
Why?! Don't you know?!
[reading another book] Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!
Damnit! [closes his book]
You did? [the other three gather around]
Damnit Cartman, wha-?!
Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! [he and the other two return to their books and read on]
Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means.
No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em.
What word could we make up?
No, uhno, not finkleroy.
Yeah, mung.
Sh. Here they come. [the New Yorkers arrive]
You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
We busted you!
[the boys stop laughing] It is?
Ooogh.
You dumbass, Cartman!
I have no idea.
I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
You found what?
[incredulous, removes his earmuffs] No way.
[to Kyle] Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
How do we write he note, Cartman?
Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played. [makes the change] Come on. [the boys leave their room again and head for the New York room.] There. [tapes the music to the door. Kyle sticks a small yellow Post-It note saying "Revised Music for Tomorrow" onto the music] That should do it.
Okay, let's get back to the room. [the three walk off]
Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants.
Oh no, dude. Look! [the projected music is shown] It's the music we changed! [the camera zooms in on the changed note]
Stop! Stop! [he and the other three are near the stage...]
Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. [Kyle and Cartman grin]
[to Kyle] Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here.
Uuuuh...
You do?
The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000
What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
Two dollars!
For one tooth?
Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.
I already lost all my baby teeth.
Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?
What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.
Uh, Butters, could we have it?
Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.
I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
[struggling with the pole with Kyle and Kenny] Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?
Well?
Oh my God!
Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. [he and Kyle grin]
[he and the others follow] Dude, where's the money?
What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
Tell us what?!
Dude.
[rushing up] You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!
Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?
So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!
The kid will never even know.
We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
[returns] Come on, Kyle! [grabs him and pulls him along]
Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the [raises his hands to make quotes] "Tooth Fairy."
[A window with stickers on it and a bush underneath is shown] There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.
This is the smartest business venture ever. [Cartman is placed into position, but a blond kid swinging from another pole is lifted into position opposite him]
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!
...Hey, you can't do that!
Because that's what we're doing!
You scram! We were here first!
You woke him up! [Cartman is lowered]
Who's the Boss?
Uuh, yeah.
Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
Well, uh-what do you mean?
What's a "tooth trade?"
Amazing.
Oh. Uh-I don't know.
How much do we get if we work for you?
We're in!
We all want double-desserts today!

[notices] Aw, shit.
What?
Really?
So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000
We win again! [all get off their sleds]
Sleds are for guys.
Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.
You got it!
Noo problem!
Oh, boy! We'll show them!
Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.
Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?
[answers] Hello?
Son of a bitch!
Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.
Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?
Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.
Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! [he, Kyle, and Kenny push off and then hop on as the sled picks up speed. The rest of the kids cheer them on]
[looks back at Clyde] Nice going, fat boy!
Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks [points to them], but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!
Come on, let's get it a try. [he and Kyle get on, and Kenny starts the sled and gets on,]
Yeah-
[to Kyle] Dude, bail! Bail! [they jump off, leaving Kenny with the brick rider. They end up face down]
[looks up] Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.
We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. [they walk up to the tree and stand in front of the puddle of blood]
Nothing else is gonna work. [the rest of the boys converge on the tree] We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.
That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!
Yeah, you stupid umbassday!
...Yeah.
Sshh! [the guard looks over]
How are we supposed to give them to you?
But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
Alright, here. [pulls some out and slips them through the holes one by one. The guard checks his watch and Cartman packs his ass]
Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. [pulls it out]
There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!
Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.
Yeah. [they walk up to the front door of a nice house. Kyle rings the bell]
Hi. Can Token come out and play?
[sees Token] Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?
It's not?
Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?
[to Kyle] Okay, go ahead and start.
Oh, uhyeah. [walks to the easel and clears his throat] Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy." [shows the title page. Kyle presses the play button for some ambiance] Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.
[flips the page to reveal a person tagging City Hall] If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?
[flips the page to reveal warring groups of people around a question mark] Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.
That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
Alright, where's Clyde.
Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!
It's Cartman!
All right! Let's do this!
Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! [the camera looks at the slope. The girls come down first, then the boys]
We're not gonna make it! [Cartman thinks, then he remembers.]
We did it!
Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.

Dude, did you do all your homework last night?
I know!
Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.
But he is-
He doesn't have to do homework?

Oh boy oh boy.
But there are no side effects, Chef.
See what?
Let's watch something else.
Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?
Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
Sounds good.
Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny.

Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!
No! [steps forward] You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!

Quintuplets 2000
Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns
Where? [a clown appears next to him, and he looks up] Oh, no. [the clown pulls out an umbrella and a bicycle horn, squeezes the horn and gets showered by the umbrella. The adults laugh, and the clown offers him the umbrella] Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye. [the clown insists Stan take part, and the parents laugh at the sound of the horn] No, thank you. [the clown tries again] Go away, please.
Two hours.
Damn, dude. [...then the Eiffel Tower, and finally, a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The crowd cheers]
Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?
Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. [the boys turn to leave]
Dude, this isn't working.
Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! [Grandpa rolls by and notices the boys in dance poses]
I'm tired, Grandpa.
I don't know. [walks over and opens the door] Whoa. [before him are the contorting Romanian quintuplets and their Grandmama, all shivering. Randy and Sharon show up in their pajamas]
Hurry up, you guys!
Dude, you're not gonna believe this.
Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania.
Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.
Okay, hold it, hold it. [climbs over Cartman and Kyle to form a tower. The quintuplets have executed their X formation. Stan is trying to stand when all three boys tumble to the ground. The quints break their formation and drop down]
What?!
[rushes up] Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
They have nowhere else to go. [presses hands together] Please?
That's your dad?
[gets up and runs to his parents] Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??
No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! [walks off]
Okay, let's try it again. Hup!
No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.
Now what do we do?
[standing in front of the still burning ruins of his house] Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!
The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
Yeah! Well, not this time!
We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side! [addresses the mob] Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!
Uh, sure, you can all get overtime.
Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!
[whistles a signal] Come on, angry mob! [the mob appears behind him. All of them move forward and overrun the checkpoint. A lagging protester runs over a fallen soldier]
Yeah.
Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.
Whatever happened to Kenny?
Cartman Joins NAMBLA
Dude, I don't understand this game at all.
Um, deny it?
Sweet.
Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.
You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!
Oh, man, that's terrible.
Haha, he-yeah ha. [makes his own blow face] Haaaaah.
[does the same] Blaaa-lalalalalalala.
[looks and then faces him. Kyle follows] We're making faces at sick people.
We don't know.
You're not more mature than us, Cartman!
Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
[angry] We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.
We got invited too, fatass!
This is boring.
[to Kyle] That seems kind of... weird.
Yeah.
Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide! [the boys run into room 1A. Mephesto shows up and leads the other look-alikes onto the hallway]
Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.
Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.
And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?
Cherokee Hair Tampons
[raises his hand] Here! [he, Kenny, and Cartman laugh heartily]
Dude, what the hell was that?

You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
[drawn out] He's fakin'!
Now, that's a get-well card! [the others laugh. Cartman soon joins them, but his nose begins to leak that white liquid again. He covers his nostrils and continues laughing]
Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher. [Kyle mumbles once more] Kyle?
Go on, Butters!
Butters, go on!
Stan
Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?
Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?
Kyle's house, morning. At Kyle's bedside, Sharon, Sheila, and Liane talk to each other while Stan keeps vigil. Three other mothers are there
What?
Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
Don't be a smartass?
Hi, doctor. [takes a seat]
Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.
But I don't think it's working.
[overwhelmed] Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.
Who? [Dr. Doctor turns the sheet around, and Cartman's picture is on it. A close-up reveals that Cartman has AB-negative blood] Oh, shit.
Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.
Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.
What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.
Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
Stan
Stan
Oh my God!
Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!
What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!
Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. [they walk away]
You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.
Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?
And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
Nobody wants to listen, Kenny.
I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.
I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do. [Kenny gets mad, Stan gets resolute] Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! [walks away]
Bus stop, night. Stan waits with a book under his arm.
[checks his watch] Come on, where are they? [looks around. Three boys approach from his left: Kenny, Butters, and Timmy]
This is it??
This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
[quite disappointed] Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!
We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney. [the others look are shocked]
Live action continues. Petri dish, on a table, with tampon is shown in front of tampon box while a light brown hand pours dyed blue water over the tampon. The tampon swells quickly.
Live action continues. Front yard of suburban home. Daughter runs up to mother who is trimming the roses.
[softly] Okay, it's clear. [slowly opens the front door] Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.
Sshhh!
If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?
Alright Butters, let's go. [they walk away and up the stairs, then down the hall, but Stan stops in his tracks] Uh-oh, Cartman's pig. [Fluffy is seen sleeping in her own little bed. Stan and Butters try to sneak past, but she opens her eyes] Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay. [Butters accidentally steps on Fluffy's tail and she squeals in panic. This wakes Cartman, who blinks and heads for his door half-asleep] Come on, we gotta get outta here! [runs a bit, then has his back to the wall as Cartman opens the door and walks out] Oh, no!
Oh, phew.
Okay, here we go. [opens the book and leafs through. Pictures of the heart, fingers, liver, and cutaway of the male genitalia are shown. Stan giggles softly and turns the page to a picture of the kidney] Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...
...vein right, well- [brings out the saw] Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up. [Butters pulls the sheets, Stan the shirt, and something more is in their way] No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!
You suck, Cartman!
God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!
[despondent, voice cracking] There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!
[sobs] My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it. [begins to break down] Oh, God, he's my best friend... [weeps]
Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again! [weeps]
So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.
Dude, please. Kyle needs it.
Alright, alright, here. [hands him a bloody kidney. Cartman reviews it.]
You look a lot better.
Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.
Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!
It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.
Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?
Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches. [laughs a long time with Kyle]
Chef Goes Nanners
You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.
Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag.
Islam??
Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.
Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.
But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.
Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!
I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.
Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. [Mr. Broflovski enters]
Do you think they should change the flag?
That was a good one.
[recovered, looks at the flag] Wait, I don't get it.
Something You Can Do with Your Finger
Cartman
Woman
Fingerbang
Cartman's room, night. He's tossing and turning joyfully in his sleep. The song continues playing in his mind:
Cartman
Boy band?
Dude, we don't have any musical talent.
He's right.
Well, I guess.
Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. [Randy reacts, and Shelly takes notice]
Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.
[voice shaking] Cartman says we can make $10 million.
Cartman
Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.
[reads from a list] Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski.
[hands him the sheet]
Cartman
Cartman
Cartman
Cartman
Aw, come on, dude. Let her try.
Cartman
Come on, nobody's gonna notice.
She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?
Costumes? [the band gathers around the box]
Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
Hey, Cartman, what does "fingerbang" mean, anyways?
Kenny says that's not what it means.
[to Kyle] Uh oh, mall cops.
Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.
Cartman
Manager
Manager
Yeah.
Uh-oh.
Cartman
We are making a music video.
Dad, I was just a--
Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?
Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.
No.
Dad!
It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?
Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.
I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--
Dad? What the hell is going on?
Randy
Randy
Randy
Randy
Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.
[left with his thoughts] ...Oh-kay.
[enters] Dad?
Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.
Yeah.
Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
Really?
Alright! [father and son get up and leave the bedroom. Randy tosses his magazine aside]
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Oh, yes we do.
Cartman
You were great, Dad.
Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
I don't think they sell those anymore. [gets up and follows his dad off; Wendy gets up and follows him]
Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?

Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school.
We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! [turns around, runs to the altar, and turns right. Kenny follows him]
[quite afraid] Are we gonna go to hell?
What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
But crackers are his- body.
Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.
No??
Confession? [Kenny snaps to attention, jarring music plays in the background]
Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
Have you confessed all your sins yet?
Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.
Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?
What, Butters?
Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.
I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-
Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!
The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-
God damnit!
[notices someone and points] Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy. [he and Kenny walk over to her. She's kneeling before a table of candles and a portrait of Jesus] Sister Anne?
We have a question.
Where do handicapped people go when they die?
But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?
What happened??
I don't think so.
Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. [the boys exit]
Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more.
Cartman!
Dude, you just said "ass"! That's a sin!
Oh, shit! [covers his mouth with his gloves.] Oh!
But what about them?
Okay, come on. [he, Cartman, and Kenny leave]
Come on! This stupid light won't change.
We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
Uh, come on, let's go. [the kids begin to cross the street, Kenny first, but...]
[finally reacts, shrilly] ...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
He's doomed.
[tries to open it] Oh no! It's locked!
[sees something off to the side] Confession box is over there! [moves towards it]
You're a sinner!
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
[passes out material] Pamphlet. Pamphlet. [from a child's view, the pamphlet is seen. It's called "Kids Against Hell" and has a quote from Ezekiel 5:10. It is soon lowered for a good shot at the growing crowd of kids at the street corner]
Probably
Let's go. [the kids begin to cross the street, Kenny first, but a tour bus slams into Kenny and takes him away. The other kids freeze where they are, petrified]
[finally reacts, shrilly] ...they've killed Kenny!
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
[joins Cartman on the platform] Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.
What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
Wow, cool.
Yeah!
What?
Kenny?! [move towards the phone] What's he say?
Dude, that seems kind of... weird.
What worked?
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
[he and Kyle are now angry] Well, what about going to hell and all that?!
Dude, I an so disillusioned right now.
Yeah!
Fourth Grade
Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.
Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up. [looks left and sees someone] Hey, come here [signals a boy over.]
What grade are you going into?
Stupid third grader!
Denver? [Butters and Clyde arrive]
Alright. [turns to face the gathering group] Hey, listen up everybody! [Tweek and four others arrive, then Timmy...] We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! [the other kids smile]
[with a look of determination] Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, "KISS MY ASS!!!" all together!
...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.
Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, "KISS MY ASS!!!"
We got you covered, Timmy.
Dude, look at the walls. [A new alphabet strip in Vivaldi font hangs over the chalkboard] Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.
[softly, to Kyle] ...More like, Ms. Makesmesick. [starts chuckling]
What a bitch!
This is it. The end of innocence. [grows sad] This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.
Kyle
Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!
[a bit dramatic] We travel back in time.
It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there.
Back in the third grade.
Oh! Here she comes.
Yeah!
Timmy, you have to stop!
No??
So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?
My God!
Over here, over here!
Less than 20 minutes?!
Well, who didn't see that coming?
...nine, eight...
Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
W-what did you get in a fight about?
Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!
Alright, come on, guys. [the boys exit the basement and head up the stairs] Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!
God-damnit, this is ridiculous.
Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?
I know.
Wait a minute! I've got it. [knocks again]
Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!
Oh, son of a bitch!
[softly] Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.
Dude. Sh-she's right.
Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!
Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.
Trapper Keeper
Dude, what's your little brother doing here?
But isn't he only three years old?
Cool!
Wow, cool!
Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.
But they smell like pee.
Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?
Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.
Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! [just then, spikes come out of the Trapper Keeper and some of them go clear through "Bill's" hands.]
[confused] What the hell just happened?
Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?
Wow, that's amazing.
What do you think, Officer Barbrady?
Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!
Yes!
So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?
Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!
Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!
Cartman!
Yeah, that's fine. ["Bill" aims the phaser once again] No, wait!
Can I do it?
[takes it and quickly aims] Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy!
Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.
He's right there.
Uh-oh.
Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. [he and Kenny leave the table, with Kyle following]
[knocks on the door] Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! [Cartman hops off his chair and dances to the door. He locks it and continues singing]
[pounds on the door] Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. [he and Kyle now notice the groans coming from the room]
You break it down!
Not it! You lose, Kenny. [he and Kyle quickly step out of the way]
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Then we have to stop it before it gets there! [leads the others off the bluff and onto a waiting cruiser. "Bill" takes the wheel and Kyle takes the passenger window seat]
Cartman, you have to stop!
He is in there.
One-two-three, not it!
Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. [an indecisive appendage hovers over Rosie]
This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!
He did it!
You did it, Kyle! [to Cartman] Kyle saved your life, fat ass!
Huh, that's a bitch.
Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!
Cartman!

Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
[off-screen] That's so gross.
I'll throw in five.
[off-screen, enticing] forty-one bucks. [Kenny jumps up and starts eating it. The others groan and moan] Eww-ho-hoo! He did it!
Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. [Clyde and Token come in from the right, Wendy and Bebe come in from the left. Stan comforts Kenny.]
Well, at least you got it out of your system.
Oh, you guys!
You know, dude, there might be something to this.
We knew he wouldn't make it.
I don't believe it.
Did you like the old one?
We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.
[to Kyle] What's a prostitute?
Chef, what's a prostitute?
Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?
Chef, what's a prostitute?
Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
Like what?
No.
James Taylor
Chef
Chef and James Taylor
Chef
Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!
Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?
[enters and runs to the stage] You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
For giving Howard Stern a hummer!
I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
I know! [Kyle gets an idea. He and Stan descend the steps to talk to the new Cartman, who stands nearby]
[walks up and puts the hood back on the new Kenny] Deal, druggie!
[pointing] Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.
The Wacky Molestation Adventure
[rushes up with Cartman and Kenny] Dude! [Kyle looks] You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
[blinks at Cartman, who blinks back] Well, of course your parents said you can't go!
Castro
Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.
The police?
But what do the police do to them?
Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.
What's going on?
[steps forward] ...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
You guys, stop it! [glides down from a tall pole in the school gym and jumps to a spot in front of the couple] Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.
How come you wanna help the fatass?!
You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!
You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?
If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?
Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
[with a torch, walks up to a chalk drawing on a wall of a family] Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. [a drawing of broccoli is shown]
[walks past a drawing of Cartman] And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. [stops at a drawing of two police officers arresting an adult, with a squad car in the background], by using the magic M word. [a large M is shown]
Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. [a drawing of a statue]
The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. [an angry Provider shoots bolts of lightning from his body, and two victims are at his feet]
So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. [the two books are shown, with the line between them]
We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.
Yes. No foolies.
[receives it] Awesu-home!
No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!
It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.
[all the kids turn from the altar and face the couple] Parents?
He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.
Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!
Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.
Hey, you guys came back!
Huh.
I dunno. [to Kyle and Cartman] You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
A Very Crappy Christmas
[picks up the phone] A-ah huh.
Ho-o-oh.
What is this all about, Kyle?
I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.
Nobody's paying any attention. [Amber clears her throat as a foot comes down over Simon, and the foot pulls away]
[emotionally] This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. [Cartman clicks the remote, and "A Charlie Brown Christmas" pops up. Charlie, Lucy, and Snoopy are on screen]
How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
[affecting a Peanuts accent] And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.
What, dude?
We don't know anything about animation.
Yeah! And we can call it... "The Spirit of Christmas" [onscreen, Snoopy is pummeling a naked Charlie Brown hard across the face with a 2-by-4]
It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.
[impatient] Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!
[retorts] That's not me, that's you!
[grabs the poster] No, that's okay. [walks away]
Grass it's eaten by cattle, which is eaten by women and men

Stan's house, basement, day. He hands out scripts to the other three boys
Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.
Sound man
[the sound man presses a few buttons, and some white noise blasts through the boys' headphones]
Stan
Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
[calmly] Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. [Kyle cues the piano player, who begins playing]
Cartman
You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! [the sound man begins to laugh heartily]
What's awesome?
That's not in the script They do this all the time.
Easy.
Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas
Okay. [snaps the shot] One.
Kickass!
Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. [both turn aside to look around]
[softly] E mouths...
[snap] 1 [snap] 2.
"We wish you a m- Merry"
AAAAAAAA!
That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!
We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!
Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!
To people like you, and me.
You hope, and I'll hurry.

Stan's house, basement, day. Stan and Kyle have to work without Cartman, so they stand wearing headphones and reading the script aloud
"Awgh! I'm so fat!"
[with tongue filling his mouth] "Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"
[Doing his and Cartman's parts]
Kyle
Cartman: Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! [both boys grin, and the sound man signals his approval with a thumbs-up]

Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!
You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!
the film snaps in two and grinds to a halt. Fear strikes the boys' faces, then the Mayor's face. The film spools out of the reels and Mr. Hankey holds the unwound film in his hands
For nothing.
Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu. Christmas still is about one very important thing.
[angrily] No not ham!
...Christmas is about something much more important!
[voice softens] Presents.
Don't you see, Kyle?
Presents.
Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
Wow! Count me in!
End of A Very Crappy Christmas. Rats rush in from all sides and nibble on Kenny's body.

What?
Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.
So?
What?!
They can't say "shit" on television!
Holy fucking shit!
Aw, come, on dude! This is history.
Sh!
Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say "shit?"
Where are you going, Kyle?
But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say "shit" and you're gonna miss it!
Oh.
I can't believe they actually said it. [Kyle returns with some food]
Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?!
Me neither.
Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,
[pleased] Oh this is great!
South Park, some days later. The town has taken to using the S word, with Shit-themed stores and products all over the place. People proudly sport the word on their shirts. An elderly couple walks out of Shit 'n Things and stop just outside the door
This sucks. Now that "shit"'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore.
What's meecrob?
What?
What's that?
What's the Black Death, Chef?
Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here. [points]
Word of curse?
Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.
Holy shit!
Uh oh.
Now what are we gonna do, Chef?
Oh shit!
What are we supposed to do with it?
It might hold the key to a curse.
Dude, we need help from the British!
You know what it is?
Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew "curse word" meant... curse word.
Look, there's the F-word.
All the world destroyed?
Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.
And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.
Yeah! And Kenny didn't die!
Holy shi- [quickly taps his mouth with his hands and releases] poop.
Cripple Fight
It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know.
Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. [all but Cartman laugh]
[calling to the back] Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??
Hey, it's Big Gay Al!
See ya, Dad!
Jimmy's funny, dude.
Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?
Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?
Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.
You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome!
We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!
And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!
Cartman, don't say "use him", you big silly goose. [Randy bears down on the brakes, causing Timmy to roll backwards and into the back window]
[a bit softly, eyes fixed on his fater] I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose.
Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-
[glances at Cartman] ...Asshole. [looks at Randy again]
Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! [Jimmy walks up on crutches to the mic and begins]
Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!
Kicked out? Oh no!
Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.
What do we want?
When do we want it?
What do we want?
When do we want it?
What do we want?
When do we want it?
What do we want?
When do we want it?
Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. [a little girl stands at the market's entrance]
Alright, let's set up. [the table's legs come down and Cartman's picket is hung in front of the table. A mic and sound system are set up next to the table. A customer exits the market, and Stan whips out a petition board] Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays? [the customer gets away, but another one comes] Uh, hello, gays in Scouts? [the customers ignore him] Goddamnit! [All the while Timmy looks down angrily at Jimmy]
That's a great idea! [takes the mic] Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!
Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. [he and Cartman leave the table and go towards Jimmy and Timmy. Timmy and Jimmy face off and start circling each other]
Jesus Christ, dude! [a crowd begins to gather]
We did it! We did it!
Huh?
So wait, did we do good?
[stops at Timmy's room and enters. Timmy stops work to listen] Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! [walks out]
Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay.
Super Best Friends
What's going on? [he and Kyle have ice cream cones. He has vanilla, Kyle strawberry]
How'd he do that??
No way!
His a-miracles?
Yeah!
[talking to a boy between him and Cartman] Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.
No, I'm Stan.
Who are you?
Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here.
Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.
I don't care! I'm leaving! [walks towards the door, but a man blocks the way] 'Scuse me. [eerie music begins]
I'm going home.
You said we're free to leave whenever we want
Move out of the way.
I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.
[begins to back away, intimidated] That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay.
Okay, it's all clear. [exits with Kyle]
We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!
A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!
Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!
Oh wait, who am I again?
Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second. [pulls out his hat and puts it on] Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!
Kyle, please. You- [looks down and to the left, then looks up] You're my best friend.
HaaAAAA! [the car totals the bike, bumps Stan onto the sidewalk, and peels away.]
Hi, Jesus. It's me.
This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!
I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.
Can you do it again?
That's it? That's how you did that trick?
That trick sucks, Jesus.
Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.
But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.
Then what are we going to do.
Super best friends?
To where?
[shuts his eyes] I am ready.
Yeah.
So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?
Wow.
I knew it.
Wow, the Moses.
[emerges from the crowd and looks around the Reflecting Pool] Kyle! Kyle!
Kyle?? [frantically, he goes into the pool and reaches the boy, turning him over. A few seconds of observation and... gasp] Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle? [looks to his left and calls out] Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
[reaches Kyle] Kyle!
Kyle, you can't kill yourself!
Kyle, you have to hold your breath! [a giant stone hand comes down and grabs the bubble as Stan looks on helplessly. Everyone backs away from the stone Lincoln as it holds Kyle in its left hand. Lincoln shakes Kyle around like a snow globe, and Stan gets mad] Oh, very funny! [Seaman and Joseph Smith pour the raw materials needed for a statue into Jesus' mold, and Mohammad fires the statue like a piece of clay. The likeness of John Wilkes Booth appears on the statue]
[with mic. Kyle and Cartman stand some distance to his left] Listen up, everyone! [the Super Best Friends gather behind him] You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all.
Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle.
Scott Tenorman Must Die
Kyle
What's no big deal?
Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
He's lying. [turns and walks away. Kenny follows, then Kyle]
[looks away and hides his eyes] We don't wanna see them, Cartman! [Kyle turns around, Kenny shuts his hood tight]
What??
Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.
When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!
Scott
One please.
Scott
Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?
[looks over at Kenny's corpse] Oh my God, he killed Kenny.
Got what all figured out?
Yeah.
Phil
This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman.
Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?
Jesus Christ, dude!
Who are you?
Good call.
Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow
Oh man, this is another rerun.
Because I had an itch up my ass.
When are they gonna make new ones?
What's this?
Enough! I know!
Dude! Did you get 'em?
Yep. Tomorrow night.
Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night.
No, dude, we really, really do.
Huh?
Yeah, he looks terrible.
Uuuuhh.
Phillip? That's not Phillip.
Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this. [they reach the dressing room, but a bouncer stands in the way] 'Scuse us.
It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.
You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.
Man, this sucks!
I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here.
But where's Phillip?
Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip.
What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?
Oh no, dude.
They're not together anymore, dude.
But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end? [Kenny continues playing with his plane]
[reaching Phillip] Phillip! Phillip!
Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.
[stammering] Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-
But we need you!
He'll do it, dude.
Two thousand dollars.
Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.
I'm sure they'll be here any minute.
Oh my God!
Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first.
Fine! [the boys leave the stage]
[panting] Okay. Okay, I think we lost them.
Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason.
Go! Run run run! [Kyle wails, Kenny keeps up somehow]
Come on, Kenny, hurry up!
They're back!
It sure did.
Cartmanland
"There you are, Jennifer Lopez!" [Stan's face appears, and it's instantly clear that the car and Lopez are dolls] "You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."
"It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez." [inserts a small firework next to Lopez in the tiny car]
Yeah, awesome!
...Why?
You'd better not be lying, Kenny. [the three walk out of view.]
Oh my God.
Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. [walks away, but Kyle stays behind, in doubt]
Kyle? [at the front of the synagogue, Kyle sits in the first pew right, and a shaft of moonlight shines down on him from the rose window over the altar. Stan approaches] Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?
Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--
Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.
[on the sofa] Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start.
What's that?
Heh, heh. [Kyle glares at him] Sorry.
Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.
[hops off the sofa and heads for the door] That does it, dude!
We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! [Kyle hops off and takes his seat ring. Both boys leave]
Come on, dude!
Aw, crap.
Dude! [rushes out of the park to Kyle]
Alright, let's go.
You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!
You'll see! We'll get in! [walks off with Kyle as Cartman glares after them.]
Dude, are you okay?
Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.
Jesus.
Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!
It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!
AGGH! [The guard escorts him away] This isn't over, Cartman!
Kyle, you gotta see!! [the doctor looks at him. Sheila and Gerald turn around]
Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?
Then damnit man, do it!
Look, Kyle. Look. [smiles]
Kyle!
Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable. [a shot of Cartman on his knees, sobbing] Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.
Proper Condom Use
[voice only] "So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!"
[face appears] "That's what you said last time [pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket], but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures" [moves the magnifying glass over the doll's body and fixes it there, focusing the sun's rays into a point]
"Scream for me, bitch!"
Oh no, what now?
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Whoa, cool! [the dog quickly stands up and walks off]
I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?
[rushes in with Sparky] Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!
But it's super-cool!
Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket.
[his parents turn at the sound of his voice] Red rocket, red rocket!
I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket. [the other adults turn away or show shocked looks]
My room? Why?
No!
Why?! What's the big deal?!
I was doing "red rocket" to make the dog's milk come out.
Huh??
What things??
No!
Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?
It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.
Yeah. [they approach the girls] Hey Wendy, did you guys get-
You guys, we just wanna know-
Why?
...A what?
Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.
[moves towards Wendy] But Wendy, we don't understand how that-
Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick.
Yeah, we need condoms!
Why does that matter?
Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.
Doesn't it give any other directions?
Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!
How do you feel?
Alright, here, everybody. [begins to move from his end to the other, visiting each of the boys] Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on.
Man, this condom's driving me crazy.
From sex??
All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!
Yeah, come on guys, this is war! [leaves his seat and heads for the door. The other boys follow]
Ha! They're your diseases!
That does it! Attack! [the boys rush the stronghold]
We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.
But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?
Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?
Towelie
HA, I blew your head off!
Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?
Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet.
Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!
Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.
[looks up at his mom] What is it, Mom?
The 2001 Okama GameSphere?
There it is. The Okama GameSphere. [the game console is shown, along with two controllers and several boxes containing the console]
What's that?
Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend. [checks his watch.] It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!
What?
Dude, we got GameSphere.
What?
...O-kay.
No. [Towelie looks for a few moments, then walks away]
G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere.
Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!
Well, it's alright. We can still play for [looks at his watch] six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball.
Okay, we will.
Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!
No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.
Oh, uh, I'm sick.
But Mom...
Can't believe we have to go to school!
We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. [a green car pulls up in front of them. Two soldiers are in it]
Fine.
This is gonna be one looong-ass day. [Ms. Crabtree pulls up and the boys get on the bus.]
That was the longest day of school ever!
It... it was right here.
Hello?
What? Who-who is this?
Don't hurt it! [Click. Stan then hangs up]
They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
Towelie!
I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.
This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
Hey yeah. [goes into the street and clears his throat] Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool! [looks around. So do the others] Aaah. Let's go take a shower! [all look around] Let's go waterskiing!
Come on, dude! [the others follow]
They said the gas station outside of town.
Who is that? [squints his eyes and blocks the light. Towelie does the same]
'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.
You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
Goddamnit, what now?!
[disinterested] Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. [leads the others away]
[grabs the guard by the lapels and throttles him] Where is our Okama GameSphere?
Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?
Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. [they go for the truck. From a distance in a woods nearby, a commander looks at the troop movements]
A little more gas, Kenny. [Kenny presses down on the gas pedal]
Brake, Kenny, brake. [Kenny brakes, and Stan steers the truck to the right to go down the dirt road. Towelie moves to the window]
[sighs] Dude, don't you remember where it is?
Alright, so where is it?
Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny! [Kenny brakes angrily and the truck jerks to a stop] Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!
What?
Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?
We don't care.
Dude, we don't care.
We... don't... care.
[dismissive] Don't care, don't care, don't care.
Can you tell us where "that" is, please?
We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?
Yeah. [the boys join Towelie and all go to jump from the helicopter]
What?
So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?
[getting impatient] Hurry up, stupid parachute!
Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.
Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine! [gives Towelie the joint] Here's your stupid lighter. [tosses Towelie the lighter, and Towelie lights up. The bloodshot eyes return.]
No, Towelie, the entry code!
God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.
Do you have our Okama GameSphere?
Oh God, don't care, don't care.
So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
But we don't care!
We're just going in to get our video game back.
Hello? Hello, anybody here? [GS-401 hops down from the rafters]
Ohmigod, look! [in front of a monitor connected to a long table is the Okama GameSphere the boys had been wanting to get back. The boys rush to it]
Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays. [behind him, Towelie exits screen left as the two forces face each other. The boys quickly get lost in the game play]
Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!
Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! [Kyle swings ever closer to the GameSphere]
[feels Towelie slip] Aw, crap!
Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!
Oh, dude, we finished level 50!
Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.
Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants
Butters, what the hell are you doing?
Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!
There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.
[approaching] Hey Mom, door bell's ringin'.
Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!
We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! [looks back at Randy] Do you have some scissors to get this open?
Well alright. [pushes the package back towards the front door. Randy returns to the kitchen... Sharon bolts from the sofa as Randy rushes back into the living room]
We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back.
Oh, it's just a goat. [all rise]
[now next to the goat] Hey there, little guy.
I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.
Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle.
Kenny?
My parents will never let me keep a goat
No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to [removes the return address from the box] take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat. [takes the goat's reins and leads it away. The other boys follow]
Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please?
They're not.
Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them. [leads the goat away. The others stand there for a second, then catch up to them]
I don't care! We're going!
Okay, thanks, Towelie. [rolls his eyes]
Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!
[now in the base with the others] Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes.
[peeks out] Okay, it's clear. Come on! [moves out with the goat and the other boys. A shadow falls across them]
Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys.
[turns right and walks off] Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions.
'K, let's put him on here. [walks up the ramp, pushing the goat along]
[enters and soothes the goat] Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours.
Dude, looks like we're going tooh... Afghanistan.
Twenty hours!
[finds the goat next to Kenny] Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home! [pulls out the return address] We have to find this address. [leads the goat off. The other boys follow]
Hey look! There's a taxi! [horse-drawn, with small back tires. The boys head for it, passing a street performer.]
[to the driver] Hello. We need to go... [hands the driver the address] here. [the driver says: شما می‌خواین برین خونه؟ "You guys wanna go home?" and whips the horse into action. The taxi moves off]
I think so. [steps up and knocks on the door]
A-ah, hi. We're from America. [Akmarh simply looks back] Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat?
Here. Wu-we don't want it.
No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat.
Oh uh, and here. [pulls out a small flag] Take this American flag as... a gift. [hands it to Akmarh and backs up. Akmarh considers the gift for a few moments, then throws it on the ground and steps back. The fat kid moves up and pours some fuel on it, then the poor kid strikes a match and throws it on the fuel, setting the flag on fire.]
Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America.
Hey! Hey, open the door!
How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do?
Alright. [leads the others away. The goat follows. Stan hears the hoofbeats and stops] Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad.
What? [voices rise in the distance (مرگ بر آمریکا! مرگ بر آمریکا "Down with USA" or "Death to America"! The boys look on. The protesters march by the boys and stop, curious about the boys standing there. Stan greets them] Howdy. [the protesters remain motionless]
[buries his face in his hand in disgust and shakes it] Cartman, you stupid asshole! [the crowd roars with anger and ties the four boys and the goat up. Two of the protesters talk about what to do next. One of them ends with]
You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! [one of the guards says something]
Dude, these people are insane.
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war.
But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?
[considers the argument...] ...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!
...He's got us there, dude. [pan out to see more fighting]
Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing. [the Afghan boys turn around] Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all.
Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too.
Come on, let's go get to the plane. [turns left and walks away. The others follow. On the way there, Stan sees a flag on the ground and approaches it. He goes down on one knee, picks up the little flag, blows the dust off it, sets it into the ground, takes off his jacket, and wraps it around the base of the flag ]
No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.
[rises, steps back, and salutes] Go America.
[follows] Yeah, go Broncos.
How to Eat with Your Butt
[reaches for his hat and puts it on] I didn't smile. [hops off the stool and walks away. A wider view shows Ms. Choksondik's class in line off to the right. The kids move forward. Butters heads for the stool]
[joins Kyle at the end of the line] Did you go yet?
What's he want?
Goddamnit Cartman, what?! [Cartman hands him the carton and erupts in laughter as Stan and Kyle look it over]
That isn't funny, Cartman.
...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.
No way! [Cartman turns around and looks again, frowning]
Cartman, where are you going?? [Cartman keeps walking. The Thompsons simply shrug their shoulders, looking at each other]
Oh boy.
Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.
Yeah, you missed them turning around.
What?
Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.
How the hell should we know? [the kids stop before a house]
There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!
Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!
[noticing] Hey, you're laughing, Cartman.
Huh?
Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.
Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.
Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.

Hey dude.
What the hell was that?
I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.
Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype.
Book. Later, dude. [leaves the desk, walks to the door and around Kyle, and exits. Kyle Two gets out his own writing book and starts writing. Kyle's breathing can be heard, and Kyle Two stops. Kyle eats a bit of cracker and Kyle Two resumes writing. After a while he grimaces, then buries his face in his arms]
Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.
Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. [he and Kyle watch the plane lift off]
So dude, did Cartman's idea work?
Damn!
Yeah, haha.

Your family is rich, dude.
Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.
Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?
[gets up and walks over to Token] Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway. [stops next to Token]
[looks at the disk] What's that?
DVD? We don't own a DVD player.
Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do. [heads for the door]
Next shot, a mansion in the Hollywood Hills. The camera pulls back to show Will Smith reading Forbes Magazine
I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.
I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman! [leaves Kyle and kicks Cartman in the nuts. When he turns around Kenny kicks him in the nuts.]
Oh hey, there's Token. [Token approaches them from the opposite direction]
Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?
Sure, dude, you're our friend.
Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.
Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.
Yeah, I get it for that.
Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.
[walks past Token] Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic.
Kenny Dies
Well that burned a long time.
[all three rush to the new dung] Oh dude, there goes one.
What, Butters?
Tell him we're busy.
Alright, let's go see what he wants. [the boys turn right and leave. Butters stays behind and looks at the melted turds. He approaches, squats, and sticks his finger in it]
What?
A boat?
Well WHAT, Cartman?
Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!
Stem cells?
[later]
Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy.

Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck.


Alder Research Group, some days later. Cartman enters, hauling the thirty-three aborted fetuses behind him in a wagon. Workers around the lab move stuff around
Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.
The principal? Aw, come on!
Wait. What's going on here? [he and Kyle back up a bit. Their parents join them]
Well how sick?
[after a pause] ...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?
Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.
[tearing up] ...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend.
No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! [buries his face in Randy's arm and begins sobbing]
Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.

No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! [buries his face in Randy's arm and begins sobbing]
Liane
[looks up at Kyle] Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!
[finds his voice] I- [looks at Kenny, then at Kyle, then at Kenny, and rushes out the door]
I can't, I just can't.
[turns around] I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.
And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!
[turns around and walks away] Just leave me alone!
[turns once more, with tears in his eyes] I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! [turns and leaves. Kyle turns to go back to the hospital, but sighs silently]
Hey Chef.
Bad.
Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?
But then, why does God give us anything to start with?
I think I understand.
It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes
I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
Congressman 1
Congressman 2
Congressman 1, Cartman
A few Congressmen
Everyone
And we would scream together songs unsung
It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what our hearts meant
The heat of the moment
shone in your eyes
Planned Parenthood, day. Cartman, in shirt and tie, is outside with clipboard in hand, talking to a woman about to have an abortion.
Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now.
Hey, Kenny! [grins, then is stunned. The room is empty. Kenny is gone. Due to terminal illness.] Oh no. [Kyle walks up to the room, but stays outside] No.
But... [a shot of the bed reveals a teddy bear on the floor] I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye. [another shot of the bed reveals a teddy bear on the floor] Did he say anything before he went?
I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. [the doors fly open and Cartman walks in. He sees his friends and they look back.]
What, Cartman? What's happened?
This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?
Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend! [Kyle gives Cartman a good roundhouse right and Cartman falls on the ground, face first.] Cartman was! [Kyle continues beating Cartman up]
Butters' Very Own Episode
'It's "The Butters Show"' appears over a wallpaper design of Butters' head. This is the show's splash screen
Butters

Butters
Whoa, are we stoppin' for sodas? Hey, can I have chocolate milk? [the driver opens the door, plucks Butters out, set him by the side of the road, closes the door, and heads back for the driver's side. He gets in and drives off. Butters watches him go, then turns to face the receding truck...] He must like TGI Fridays
Butters
A voice
"The Butters Show" splash screen
Butters
Butters was missing?
Damn, dude.
Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.
Really?
Butters
Jared Has Aides
Oh, dude, look! [the others look up and the phone falls off Cartman's lap to the floor] It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!
Cartman living room. Butters walks in.
Hey Kenny.
We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! [Stan and Kyle hop off the sofa and head for the front door]
Randy
What kind of help?
I'll bet you can.
Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.
[following] Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.
You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight...
Cartman
Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls.
Jared
Marry him?
[notices] Chef, we need more food.
[soberly] Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.
How do you feel, Butters?
Alright, now it's time for phase 2.
We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.
Did you bring the camera?
That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!
[Kyle finally produces the camera] Did you eat only one ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
All prepared for liposuction surgery?
[shoots back] Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. [Cartman makes sure the scalpel is sharp]
Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.
We've gotta hurry this up. [moves behind the coffee table to Butter's belly and starts pounding on it. The fat begins flowing out faster]
He's losing weight. [Kyle smiles]
Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home.
Dude, bail! [the three boys rush out the back door, then the front door opens and Butter's parents walk in. The living room is a mess]
Come on, Butters. Time to go.
What?
...Kenny would have done it.
Alright, it's settled. Come on, Butters. [pulls Butters out the door. Cartman enters the house]
That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared!
What?!
Wait. Everyone hates Jared now?
Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out. [the boys exit the store]
No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have "AIDS," AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides.
Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?
Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions!
[takes off his hat and throws it on the ground] Oh God-damnit!
Why?
Well, so much for our money.
Asspen
He's such a douchebag.
[watches as Cartman climbs the sofa] Yeah, and then what?
They're still asleep.
What's a Hitler?
No, I never have.
Smell what?
Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.
Uhh... no.
Stan. Marsh.
Dude, I'm just learning.
I never said I was.
...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...
Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
[winces and covers his face with his right hand] Oh no.
Heather? [a woman skis up and stands next to the skier]
[just looks at them] ...who are you people?!
All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?
Okay.
Yeah, prob'ly.
Fries... fries...
[drops his poles] Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. [a group of young adults walk by carrying Tad high in the air. The group stops, the boys turn around to see]
Thanks. Who are you?
It seems fine.
Don't care. [the boys go further onto the dance floor]
I dunno.
Oh,. God. [buries his face in his hand again.]
Gah, let's go you guys. [turns around and leads the others towards the door...]
Dude, what the hell is your problem?!
I raced you, You won!
What?
I'll be there, you queen!
Yeah!
Dude, I have to!
Dude, he's got Heather!
I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?
...Thank you.
This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!
[approaches] Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.
I have to do this, okay? I have to!
[Thumper and Stan do some Tai Chi on their skis, then Thumper has Stan ski down the hill blindfolded while he takes notes on technique and time]
That's when you need to put yourself to the test
[The teen girl is reading to Stan from a book: Skiing for "DUMBASSES." Then Thumper spots Stan as Stan does barbells, then has him do a few more runs. The times aren't satisfactory.]
And just show a lot of things happenin' at once.
[Bulldozers show up at the youth center to knock it down, but a group of families shows up to protest the demolition. Next shot, the parents are still at those meeting, getting quite weary and tired]
And with every shot, show a little improvement
[Stan skis down a little faster, and Thumper shows him how much he's improved. Tad is then shown polishing his skills, landing after a ski jump and receiving Heather into his arms. The girl reads to Stan some more, but Stan's fallen asleep. She rouses him and resumes the lesson]
In any sport, if you want to go
[she shows Stan a few pictures in her book. Next, Stan is skiing down the hill with bricks weighing his shoulders down. Kyle stands on a bluff with a picture of himself and Stan and looks wistfully at it and at K-13. Cartman rubs his finger into his ass and gives a sleeping Butters the Hitler again. Cartman stifles a laugh]
Always fade out (Montage) into a montage (Montage)
[Again, Stan skis down the hill with Thumper looking on. Now Thumper approves of the time. The instructor, the teen girl, and Stan look out at K-13 from a nearby hill, the camera at their backs]
If you fade out it seems like a long time (Montage) has passed in a montage (Montage)
[The camera faces the trio now and zooms out slowly. Stan sets his skis down and steps into them, then skis down the slope. Fade out]
Aspen Heaven meeting room, day. Two officers are present with the two salesmen and the six parents.
Pizza... pizza... pizza...
Thanks. [Tad reaches the finish line to see the celebration start without him. He takes off his goggles and throws them to the ground in anger]
Where the hell have you guys been?!
No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! [turns right and leads the other boys away]
Freak Strike
Hm, that sounds pretty good.
Hey Kenny! [the three boys grin]
Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povich freak show is on.
Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
What disease should we say?
[drops his hands] What? [the others follow]
This is gonna be so funny!
We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?
It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.
[looks away and up] Kenny woulda done it. [Butters reacts]
[begins to walk and lead the others away] Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. [Butters now looks chastened]
Where's you get the balls from?
Wow!
All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I
That's your flight, Butters.
Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.
Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! [pause]
Here he comes.
But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!
[on the other end] Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?
Yeah, they wanted to find you bad.
I- told them where to find you.
Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. [hangs up. Butters looks helpless, then walks to the window to see if the freaks are coming. They are indeed]
Maury
Fun with Veal
Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
Yeah, I wouldn't have.
Tomorrow morning? [a shot of the calves has Stan, Kyle, and Butters transfixed. The rest of the class leaves] Dude, we gotta help them.
[knocks twice on the wall below the window] Pst, Cartman.
[knocks twice while saying] Cartman, wake up!
We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!
We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.
[heaves softly] Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!
[plainly] Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?
Go on, dude it's the only way.
Just do it really fast, and we can go.
Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!
Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too! [holds up parts of a torch] How does this thing work, Cartman?
[softly into his headset] Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.
[looks up and calls out] I said that's far enough! [the harness drops to the floor. He gets up and unlocks himself out of the harness, and it goes back up. A calf looks back at him innocently. Stan moves up behind the calf, the softly] Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose. [removes the chain] There you go. You're free. Run away! [the calf doesn't move, and Stan gestures] Go! They're gonna murder you.
Come on, you stupid baby cows! [walks towards the door and lifts up the security bar, then opens the door] You have to get out of here. [they just lift their heads and look at the entrance. The other boys join Stan inside the veal ranch]
They aren't leaving.
Oh yeah, they're too weak to move. [a shot of the calves again] Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.
Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.
I don't know.
[moves towards the calves] We're just gonna have to carry them one by one. [lifts up his first calf] Come on, you guys. [Kyle and Butters look at each other, then move to join Stan]
We won't have to. Butters said he had something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
Butters! [Butters turns] Did you bring it?
What?
Aw crap!
[points an accusing finger at Rancher Bob and approaches] That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.
No!
You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the ones who knew we were making little baby animals suffer! [walks off to his right]
[pushing his dresser into place against the door] Kiss my ass!
I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.
[serious] Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.
[glares] Shut up, Cartman.
Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.
This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until we know the calves will be safe.
[sighs] Round one is over. We made it. [the boys gather in]
Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.
Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! [one calf takes a dump on the carpet, another walks up and takes a piss on it]
No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!
Wait, what is that? [points to the basket. The other three boys turn. Cartman approaches the window and takes the basket] Dude!
See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
[sensing a lapse] Wha? [rises and walks to his bed, where the other boys sit eating]
Dude, what are you guys doing?
You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
[returns to his corner] That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!
No, this is exactly what we wanted.
Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.
[the boys are stunned] ...I don't believe it.
[notices the situation] Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! [Butters stirs and turns around]
What are they doing here?
Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. [lifts up his shirt to show the sores to the others]
No!
Hello?
Ah, hold on. [turns to the other boys] It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?
What do I say??
Cartman, no!
O-ogh...
[looking very weak and with a few more sores on his body] It... did?
Pick me up. I... I want to see. [Kyle picks him up]
We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!
Well, I guess we learned something today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.
The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer
[pouring chips into a bowl] This is gonna be so awesome!
Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anything!
Alright, here we go.
Russell Crowe
Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!
[rushes up to her] No! Shelly, we have to watch HBC! [she switches back to HBC]
It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!
But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.
Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!
[glances down, then answers] O-K, deal.
[somber] Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.
Dude, I'm not going.
Stan.
Stan
They look fine to me. [another shot of Russell sailing away]
That's worse!
Dude!
Dude, the commercials could start any time!
Get all the stuff! [they gather the snacks and head for the front door. Cartman opens the door and Butters arrives]
We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! [the three boys exit]
Hurry! We can't miss the commercials!
Huff, huff
Aww! [the boys gather their snacks and head for the door]
AGH! [thinks hard, then] Wait! Chef just got a new plasma screen TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! [they leave. Ike goes back to the sofa and sits, changing the channel]
[impatient] Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels?
We made it!
Here they come!
I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.
Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. [looks like Russell is fighting Germans, but the menu windows block the view]
Oh God-dammit!
Come on, we gotta go somewhere else! [the four get off the sofa and head out the door. A car screeches to a halt, and the TV fires at the driver, forcing the couple inside to flee]
The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!
We made it.
But we have to watch the commercials in this show.
[the first to head for the door] Come on, we gotta get to a TV! [the others follow]
Commercial Break Number Two! [the boys are positively giddy with anticipation]
I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.
Oh, God, it's horrible! [the boys leave and exit the community]
We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!
Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!
Turn it on! Turn it on!
Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
She has to! [leads the boys out of Cartman's house]
Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!
What?
The last commercial break has to be coming any second! [two phaser blasts are seen. One kills the bearded crack addict, another knocks a trash can over. Chef's TV appears and the two remaining addicts and the boys scream]
We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??
Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! [they run off]
We made it! [grins]
Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??
Wait a minute! Look! [points and reads from the TV] "The following preview has..." This is it! This is it!
That looks AWEsome! [Cartman goes to the phone and starting dialing a number]
Oh, dude, let's go!
I wonder if it's all a western?
South Park, night. Chef's TV is still walking around, but this time away from town. It's showing the Russell Crowe show. Chef is still trying to shut it down.
Professor Chaos
[turns to the boys] Okay, here he comes. [join Cartman and Kyle]
Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you look for friendship opportunities elsewhere.
All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.
[voice over a scene of all the kids walking down Main Street at the amusement park] So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends. [cut to Stan seated on a green sofa under a spotlight] It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
[voice over a scene of all the kids walking down Main Street at the amusement park] One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.
All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny. [the camera pans over the remaining candidates] Good luck.
Okay, next? [signals for Craig to leave. Craig walks away and Token comes in to take his place. Scene music plays. A few moments for the boys to get a feel for Token]
Yeah, it's not bad. Next? [Signals for Token to leave. Token walks away and Timmy rides in to take his place. Scene music plays.]
Shut up, fatass! [silence. They look at Craig and the anger fades from their faces as they wait for him to respond]
I like it. [takes notes]
Okay, let's try this. [a shot of the field. The Jumbotron at center field loses focus and glimpses of Professor Chaos are seen]
Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? [holds up Towelie's picture]
[weary] Oh, this is giving me a headache.
[acquiescing] You're right. Well now, how about Timmy? [holds up Timmy's picture] He's quiet and he takes direction well. Really the perfect friend.
How about Token? [holds up Token's picture]
That's great.
Suckup.
The Simpsons Already Did It
Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek. [Tweek moves forward, but then backs up. Stan rises and turns to Tweek]
Just put it between its eyes.
Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?
[flatly] Oh, hey Butters.
Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
Uh oh.
Alright, I'll chip in.
The dream ends and the bubbles fade away. Cartman wakes up, smiling.
Ready. Let's see 'em.
Are they playing basketball? [Cartman picks up the box and looks at the front. A close-up of a sea couple. Cartman looks in the tank and sees just shrimp. He looks displeased, Kyle has the sign in hand again]
Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.
What are we gonna do with them?
Yeah, that'd be funny.
Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.
Oh jeez, change the channel.
They found the sea men! It's only a matter of time before they find the women, too!
We're dead!
Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!
Chef, we did something kind of bad.
[pause] We need you to promise not to tell anybody.
We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach.
[beat] So what should we do? [Chef thinks, then goes and pushes the sofa towards the door and onto the entry path]
This is it.
Yeah, stupid.
Dude, it's probably still in her stomach. [Kyle approaches the corpse in the middle of the room and pulls back the cover. Ms. Choksondik's chest and abdomen have been cut open right down the front]
What do we do now?
Do you see the sea people.
Yeah.
Aaah!
Let's go! [He, Kyle, and Tweek head out the door quickly. Cartman pops out of Ms. Choksondik's corpse gasping for air]
The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
...and then we put them back in the tank.
[turns and waves to Cartman] Okay. Goodnight, Cartman. [turns and exits. Kyle follows]
Oh no, what now? [the boys turn left and follow]
How? How did that happen?
They've already accomplished so much.
Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.
Well, drop them in! [Tweek opens the packets and drops the contents in]
That's cool.
[hands Cartman the smaller tank] Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. [Cartman takes the tank and turns it over, pouring the sea ciety into the larger tank. Screams are heard from the sea people]
...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
Hm.
Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.
Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.
Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! [the others turn around to see. Shown is a statue of Tweek in progress]
The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
Red Hot Catholic Love
That sounds pretty fun.
As the song is sung, the show's logo appears: "The Catholic Boat." A pink anchor rises and ushers in the next scene: A happy Father Michaels stroking his chin. A second anchor, and Young Boy #1 (Butters) is shown. A third anchor and Father Williams appears. He pulls his shirt up to expose his chest. The fourth anchor, and Young Boy #2 (Tweek) is shown. The fifth anchor, and three priests, Fathers Abraham, Duncan, and Ortiz, are shown partying. Father Abraham falls over laughing. Father Duncan grabs Father Ortiz behind the head and pushes the head down... The sixth anchor, and Young Boy #3 (Stan) is shown. A priest's arm appears, running the index finger all over Stan's face...
What are they talking about?
Um, cool.
...Like ...money? What?
What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? [silence. Only birds are heard]
We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest ever put anything in our butts.
We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?
What?
Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.
You've had five, dude!
Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.
What? He did.
Yeah it does.
[firmly] Yeah. It does. [Randy looks at him angrily, then wonders if it could be...]
So?
Dude, look.
Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
Free Hat
Oh, cool. A preview. [the curtain goes up and the preview, for a PG-rated film, airs]
Aw, dude, why would they do that?
That's gay. [next trailer airs. No rating seen]
Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
Goddamnit, that pisses me off!
Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!
We have to do something. Let's form a club.
No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!
Well what's wrong with it?
Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. [walks off with Cartman and Kyle screen right]
What?
Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet. [turns and opens the door, then peeks in. The place is packed. All the bleachers are filled, and there are five rows of people standing on the gym floor. He backs out, closes the door, and turns to his friends] Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!
Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.
[takes the mic] Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.
Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. [the cheering dies down and a voice pipes up]
You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?
Aaaah, ["Free Ha-"], okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? [the crowd stops moving]
Waitwaitwaitwait! [the crowd stops] Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!
Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.
...212, 213, 214 members!
Really? That's great.
If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.
When did we do dibs for it?
Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?
Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark. [the crowd begins to murmur] There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? [hands the mic to Cartman, who moves over to an easel]
That is our understanding.
It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.
Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raiders.
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.
Okay, go. [the other boys, with their own flashlights, pour in]
[finding the video library] Over here! [the other boys join him at the stacks. They see "Star Wars Episode 1, Version 300," "Star Wars Episode 1, Version 301," "Star Wars Episode 1, Version 302," etc., then "First Day of School" and "First Day of School, Digitally Enhanced," then "Wedding Video" and "Wedding Video, Digitally Enhanced." The camera scans past "Kids First Swimming Lesson" and "Kids First Swimming Lesson w/ Digitally Enhanced Weather" to stop at the reel of "Raiders of the Lost Ark, Original Negative 1982."]
Aw, really?
Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
So we have to warm his icy heart with a "hot" island song.
Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. [Lucas looks at them]
[steps forward] You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.
Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! [the boys turn and make their way to the door]
He's definitely lost it.
[pleading] You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.
[pleading] Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! [the boys quickly turn away, shut their eyes, and bow their heads]
Yuh, you guys okay. [the others open their eyes. The ropes that bound them are gone]
Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. [the boys turn and walk off. Tweek can't help but look at the baby's fate]
Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.
Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.
Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society
Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.
Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?
Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
[arriving with a group of boys: Kyle, Cartman, Token, Butters, Tweek, and Clyde] Ah, hey, Bebe.
Uh, we're gonna go throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.
Hella fun.
Cool. [the boys turn as one and walk back the way they came] We'll see you later, Bebe.
That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. [turns and walks off]
So what you do, see, is you wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. [he throws a rock towards the road and the others look at the trajectory. A blue pick-up truck drives by and is hit]
[grabs the rock and demonstrates] Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-
Hoh hoh hoh!
[beat] ...Wait, what were we doing again?
Hey, that's what I wrote about!
[grunts and pounds his desk] Hah hah, hah! [the other boys start grunting like apes]
That's such a great paper! [starts clapping. The other boys join in the applause]
Yeah.
Uh huh.
That would be best.
Kyle??
Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!
No!
Yeah!
Sure thing, Bebe.
Yeah. [they arrive, but find four other boys arriving at the same time: Timmy, Kevin, Bradley, and Francis] Where are you guys going?
Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?
[steps forward and grunts] Hoh!
Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. [goes and knocks on the door]
Cartman's?
[jumps in front of Boy 2] Hoh! [the other boys begin to grunt and face each other]
[atop a pile of boys] Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh! [he's knocked them all out and tossed them into a mound]
Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!
Hoh hoh hoh! [picks up his rock and plays with it] Hohohoh hoh!
Hoh. Hoh?
[disheveled, in his primal state] Aaaa-ta. [starts drawing another boob. The wall is covered with them, singly or in pairs. One stick-figure woman has a large pair] Aaaa-ta.
[picks up a stick and moves it around] Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.
[points to the wall with his stick] Ahta. Ah, ahta!
[turns to face his father] Hoh? Ahta. [points to the wall] Ahta.
Ahta.
Ahta? [Sharon walks behind Randy and sits on one of the sofa's arms]
[considers each argument] Friends. Ahta.
Ahta! [more grunts. Bebe enters wearing a cardboard box over her clothes. The boys quiet down.]
Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.
Child Abduction is Not Funny
I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.
Child Tracker?
...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!
I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!
Huh?
But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.
[mouth full] I'm not done with my pizza.
Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker.
But why do I have to leave?
Where are we supposed to go?
Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.
Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai. [the Mongolians laugh]
["Budu e noo"] Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. [squeezes his eyes shut and buries his face in his right hand]
Uh huh, Stan Marsh.
[to Kyle] Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. [faces forward and continues walking]
A Ladder to Heaven
We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?
Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
We've gotta find that ticket!
[hands the stub to Cartman] You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.
Where's Kenny??
[shuts Cartman up quick and stumbles for words] Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.
[climbs up to the window and looks in] Did you get it? [Kyle climbs up next to him]
Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
I can't see. [Cartman pours out the ashes and the boys sneeze from the fine powder until it dissipates. Some ash smudges remain on their faces.]
It was a trick!
Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! [gets off his stool and walks away.]
Cartman, come on!
Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
[going for some more wood] We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.
Because we wanna see Kenny again. [heaves a piece of wood back to the tower]
Townsman
Thank you! I have a new CD out with all my 9-11 songs for sale right here! [the crowd rushes in to get copies of the CD. Jackson is pleased at the interest. The boys resume their construction. Stan and Kyle are hammering away at the top of the ladder. Cartman hustles up the ladder with a car seat]
Kyle
Mr. Garrison threw away his car?
Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!
Excuse me. ["Nahurabo"] Excuse me! ["Nahurabo"] Uh, we ran out of stuff. [the singing abruptly stops] We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.
We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.
No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??
No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.
What??
Hey Kenny.
Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??
Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.
No, we have to see Kenny!
Cremated? What's that?
Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!
Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! [leaves the table]
Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree! [the last few words echo a few times]
[hands the stub to Cartman] Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. [the last few words echo a few times]
Where??
Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. [everyone turns to look at the boys]
Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...
Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
Dude, come back here! [chases after Cartman]
The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers
O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
[reaches out and receives the tape] Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!
How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
Good job, wizard.
My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.
The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. [a few seconds later some headlights shine on them]
We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
Woww.
We have come to reclaim the one tape! [Butters sits up and Kyle goes for the tape]
[takes the tape from Kyle] No, we have to return it! [the boys turn to walk away again. Butters crawls a few inches]
Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.
Nothing. [the sixth grader rips the tape out of Stan's hand] Hey, kid!
Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
Oh crap, dude!
Ogh. [Cartman sighs silently]
Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.
We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
Yes, but this is not a-- [stops, then reacts] Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. [hands the tape to Clyde]
But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.
[steps forward] Uh, well—Wait, what'd you see?
What do we do with it?
I will take it! [the boys quiet down and Stan approaches the table. He takes the tape in hand. Cartman closes his eyes in meditation] I will walk to the video store.
No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?
True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
Jimmy didn't stop them!
Just get across the river! They're coming! [the three remaining boys scramble across the river. The sixth graders arrive. Two of them stop their tires by performing wheelies and landing their bikes back on the road. The lead sixth grader rides up between them]
Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.
This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
Where?!
Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!
Closed?
[seeing a way out of this mess] Wait. A drop box. [goes to it and pulls down the door] Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!
They're coming!
Uh-oh.
Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.
...Wow. [another long moment of stunned silence]
The Death Camp of Tolerance
[coming to Cartman's defense] Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.
No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.
Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.
Yeah, but Dad-
Yeah, I have to remember that.
I guess.
[sensing what's about to happen] Oh, no, no, no no no no.
Chef, we're intolerant. [beat]
Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around them.
Are we homophobes now?
N-no?
The principal's office, a few moments later. Mr. Garrison hums as he nears the office door. He enters and stands beside an angry Chef, who has crossed his arms.
We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
Tolerance camp?
Frog King
Sparrow Prince
Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, black-and-white footage, day. The kids are in a large room the size of an airport hangar. All of them have been doing arts and crafts, as they are dirty with crayons and paint. Each column of tables is being patrolled by a guard.
Catatafish
Kyle. [helps him up and tries to rouse him] Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.
The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!
Butters!
Jesus... we have to get out of here. [other kids are passed out, some on their backs, some on their stomachs]
Catatafish
End of The Death Camp of Tolerance
The Biggest Douche in the Universe
Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.
Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.
No, that's Kenny.
That's Cartman.
Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.
Awesome!
Uh, over here please?
We told you that.
No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body.
Heh hey wait a minute dude.
He seemed better on TV?
[approaches Kyle] Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? [Cartman has a seizure; the other boys look over. Cartman goes silent, and he's shown standing unconscious.]
We don't get to go to Scotland?
[to Cartman] Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.
[moving off slowly] That's us. Come on.
Huh?
Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.
Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. [walks off]
[stops and looks at Kyle, astonished] What??
Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap! [slaps his left palm on his face]
Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.
I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.
Jesus Christ.
Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.
Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.
Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.
Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called "intuition." Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.
No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.
No dude, you're a douche.
Then you're a stupid douche.
I'm nine years old.
You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche! [walks towards the door, but notices some books on a bookcase nearby. He checks them out. "How To Be A Psychic" "Cold Reading: The Trick Of The Psychic!" "Make Women Believe You're Psychic! Then Have Sex With Them!" "How To Sixty Nine With Yourself" ...Stan senses the real reason behind John's efforts] Son of a bitch. [takes the books and leaves the estate.]
Kyle! Kyle!
Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.
Kyle, you can't run your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called "cold reading." They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.
No, he's not.
[looks around at the adults, then] Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?
Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?
Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.
Does this month, November, hold a special significance?
Right, because he's saying, "Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'"
See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.
I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying "He wishes you a Happy Birthday."
Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He's saying "the money. Stop worrying about the money."
No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.
What?! [his deconstruction didn't work. The adults crowd in]
No wait.
Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully. [the applause dies down] This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay? [puts his hand to his temple] They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.
No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, "Peter was your husband?"
[getting annoyed] Stop it! I didn't do anything!
[reminding] I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, "They want me to acknowledge Peter." That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, "I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely."
[frustrated, with right hand over his clenched eyelids] Okay. Let's back up. [each audience row backs up to the one behind it] Not literally!
Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.
Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! [throws the stack away and leaves. He reaches the front doors, opens them, and is face-to-face with John Edward]
No, I don't think either one of us can. [Kyle gets up from his seat and leaves the room]
I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!
Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!
Fine, douche! [slams one door on him...]
No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.
You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all just stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole? [the audience is listening] We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. [more audience listening, reflection. Kyle is present. One man claps, then others clap with him, then murmurs are heard]
Yeah.
There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.
No, it can't be.
Oh, dude! [smiles]
Now do you people believe me?
Announcer
My Future Self n' Me
[arriving] What's going on?
So throw it away.
You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations.
[annoyed at his friends' skittishness] It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
Fine, I will. [takes the bag and walks over to the stump, faces the boys, and tosses the joint into the bag] There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.
Aw, come on, Mom.
It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!
[rises from the sofa and walks over] Who the fuck is it, Mom and Dad?
I'm me from the past?
Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!
What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! [squeezes his eyes shut and buries them in his right hand]
Stan
[Stan's future self joins him in bed after freshening up in the bathroom] No.
Stan
Bus stop, next day. Stan arrives with future Stan.
Hey guys.
This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
Shut up, Cartman!
[under his breath] God-damnit!
Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.
I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.
I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy! [gets off his seat and starts pacing the floor] Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
Yeah, it's like everything I do, he... [stops and then looks at Butters] Wait a minute, what'd you say?
[after a moment] Dude, how long has your future self been around?
Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself from the future??
Where is he now?
Liver medicine?
Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!
Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? [starts rifling through future Stan's clothes]
Here it is. [pulls out a wallet and reads the license. It's from the future, with LOSER printed in large letters on it and an expiration date of 10-19-2043] It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this? [pulls out a Motivation Corp. key card, expiring on 12/26/02] This expires in two thousand two. Why would he have this in his wallet?
[flips the card over to see the info on the other side] Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. [heads out the door.]
Here it is. Motivation Corp. [the camera pans up to show the name of the building. Stan puts the card into the reader next to the door. The door opens and Stan heads in.]
[walks up to Butters] Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. [heads in]
What the hell is going on here?
I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
They've all been lying to us this whole time!
[closes his eyes a bit, then] Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!
They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!
It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!
Who's that?
What?
We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
...You're gay? [Butters loses his moment] It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.
But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! [walks off]
No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.
[heading for the phone] Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. [picks up the phone receiver and starts punching in the numbers]
Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America? [listens for the answer] Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?
[still on the phone] Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please? [listens and writes down the address] Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?
Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you. [hangs up] That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
Fine, then you can come with me. [heads out the door]
I guess this is it.
Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?
Cartman??
What the hell are you doing here?!
God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. [both boys turn and walk towards the door]
[turns around] Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!
How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
How much is this going to cost us?
[brightly] Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah!
That's not neato, that sucks.
You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought each revenge was unique and customized!
Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have to admit that they lied to me!
Dude!
No, that's too extreme!
Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! [leaves his seat and heads for the door.]
Hey future self.
You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hole in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about? [future Stan looks at Stan as if the boy were crazy] You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?
You must know what I'm talking about.
Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. [Sharon and Randy shift in their chairs]
No. [plants his hands along the table's edge] You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax! [crosses his arms again] And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me! [uncrosses his arms] See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.
What?
[takes a seat at the table] Hide and go seek, huh?!
I don't believe that he's my future self!
No, I actually have a way to be sure. [whips out a meat cleaver in his right hand and places his left wrist on the table] I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.
But I have to know for sure. [readies the cleaver]
Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.
Yes?
[lowers the cleaver onto his wrist. The left hand falls away, and he lifts his left arm] AAAH! [a red area marks where the left hand was]
That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.
Butters!
Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.
Butters, we're running away!
Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! [Stephen, Linda, and future Butters enter with groceries]
[watching his words fall apart] Huh?
Get the fuck out of here. [Randy and Sharon rush into the house]
Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!
I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!
I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.
Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through.
Red Sleigh Down
Cartman, why are you doing this?
Wuh, that smells. [lifts the front of his jacket over his nose]
Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. [Cartman stops]
I don't know.
Awww! [both of them release their breath and start coughing]
God, it took forever!
Hang on, Santa! [switch to Baghdad]
Why would Iraqis do that? Why?
Oh no.
Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!
I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.
Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!
We're here.
[finding his voice] Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Oh my God. Iraqis killed Jesus.
Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...
RPG, four o'clock!
[runs up to his parents] We brought Christmas to Iraq!
Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! [Cartman's joy vanishes]
Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. [Kenny walks into the frame.]
Oh, hey Kenny.
Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.
Cancelled
Dude, sweet! [Ike stands up]
Dude! Visitors!
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
Visitors are real. They... [lowers his left eyebrow and thinks, looking down] Wait a minute. This has all happened before.
No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?
I remember this whole thing. [to Kyle] Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.
What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?
Chef, we're in a repeat.
It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.
You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.
Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.
You all right?
Where to now, Chef?
What?
Go on.
Oh, nice going, Cartman!
We wanted to see an alien planet or something.
What do we do???
Let's go!
[startled] What is that?
Chef! End of the road! [several barricades are up, with STOP signs hanging on the, and one sign saying "ROAD CLOSED"]
It's the police!
Chef!! [Chef sees yet another barricade and goes towards it, forcing the worker guarding it to jump out of the way/ Chef launches into the air once again. "Dixie" is heard from the car's horn. The aliens catch up to Chef and the boys and try the same jump. They end up upside down and unable to move. Chef spins the car a bit and looks back at the police cruiser]
Uh. [stirs and opens his eyes] Wugh. You guys. Wake up! [the other boys are in pods of their own]
We're in the alien ship.
[out of his pod] Guys. Look. [the others get out of theirs and walk towards Stan]
My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.
Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.
Dad?
Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, Contact.
Okay okay, take the form of something else!
Nno, that's stupid too. [Cartman looks at Stan, deflated]
No! [the alien turns into George Burns]
I like it.
You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?
[looks back at his friends] Television? [the boys enter the next room. In that room visitors are all over the place manning the various aspects of a production company]
Our planet is just a reality-TV show?
Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!
Oh shit, did we do that?
Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!
Please, take us to them! Please!
Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?
Uh, Earth?
Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.
But sirs, we think our show is just getting good. [Kyle thinks about the food, then decides to taste it] I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.
Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.
Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!
Sirs, uh, if you'll just let-
Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. [Kenny whips out a camera and takes a picture]
[glances at Cartman and quickly thinks] No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!
I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.
Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. [Chef takes a look at the picture of the two Joozians sucking each other's jagons]
Krazy Kripples
Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude. ["or other ways."]
Yeah dude, not cool.
Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.
Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.
That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. [Jimmy and Timmy turn and walk away]
Cartman, trust me. [Kenny pushes his own truck away] We don't want any part in this one.
[admonishing] Stay clear, guys, stay clear.
Outer space. Christopher Reeve is flung into space in a pane of glass.
Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.
Toilet Paper
Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads.
See?
Mrs. Streibel thinks she's so cool!
Like what?
[glares back at her, then softly] Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!
D'you think that's enough?
Okay
Is this the right house?
Kyle, we all agreed to do this!
Let's go, Kyle! [drags him off. Kyle is transfixed for a bit, then turns to follow Stan. A last shot of the house, and then the boys reach their bus stop gasping for air.]
Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.
We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
Yes, dude!
Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.
What about him?
Butters. [looks down, then away, then sniffs, then clears his throat. After a while, Butters just walks off]
So what should we do?
[just looks at Cartman] ... Dude, we're not killing Kyle!
Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?
Cartman, what are you doing?
You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!
They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?
Butters?
He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.
It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad. [to Kyle] I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.
Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do. [points an accusing finger at Cartman] And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! [He, Kyle, and Kenny leave]
[appears] What is it, Cartman? [Kyle and Kenny trail Stan]
Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.
You, you do? How?
Wugh! Two weeks of this!
I'm a Little Bit Country
Let's go see a movie! [they stop in their tracks as they hear "No war! No war!"]
[pause] Uh... war?
Yeah. [the mic moves back to him as he looks at his sign] War is not my voice.
[pointing] You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!
No, you just have to study.
[from behind his book] Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!
How?!
Cartman?
Oh no...
Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.
Aww crap.
Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.
Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Cartman's recovery room. Cartman's mom sits by his bed as Stan and Kyle look on. Dr. Doctor enters.
I guess we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!
I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...[he quickly assaults the driver and beats him with the log, then drags the body away and returns to the Jefferson residence, knocking on the door]
Jefferson
Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-
Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war.
Oh, no, nononono.
Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-
[stops at the open door] Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww. [turns around and returns to the table] Awww, now we lost two in our study group!
Did you forget them towers in New York?
Randy
Philadelphia, day, Independence Hall. There's plenty of argument going on.
Uh, we didn't do it.
Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Daylight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-
He does? [he and Kyle are shocked]
Can't be
Randy
Everybody
Randy
What the hell are they doing now?
Fat Butt and Pancake Head
[to Cartman's hand] Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand? [slaps Cartman's hand down] Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!
Burrito. Taco taco. Burrito. Taco. Taco taco.
Cashier
What are you gloating about?
BHI President
Cartman's house, night. He's asleep, dreaming.
Cartman
Ben
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
What's the matter?
What's she doing?
I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.
Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?
Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.
End of Fat Butt and Pancake Head
Lil' Crime Stoppers
All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. [offers up a business card]
It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. [moments later they reach a pink house and Stan knocks again. The door opens and an elderly woman looks out]
Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need solved, for a dollar?
Have you reported this to any other authorities?
We're on the case.
Detective McCormick found something interesting. [a shot of Kenny, who just raises his arm and point to his right. The camera pans to Duke, the house pet, licking off the last of the pie]
You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time. [the scenario shows Mrs. Farnickle setting the pie on the sill, closing the windows and walking away] But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. [Mr. Farnickle shows up at the kitchen window, looking at the pie from inside the kitchen]
His plan was to use a hammer.
Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. [the man plunges the shovel through the woman's neck and cleaves the head from the body. Blood pours out and stains the carpet]
The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. [the man is shown tossing the second leg into the tub, then stirring the solution so that the leg would sink in and disappear]
Just the news.
[stays behind] Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady.
Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar! [shows off a crisp new one-dollar bill]
Yes it is!
All right, Sarah, come over here. [everyone moves over to Kenny's desk. Sarah hops up on the witness chair] Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.
You got it, Ken? [Kenny finishes and nods]
Put that away, dude! [Kenny walks up to a small bulletin board of KeNnY'S mOST WANtED women, all of which have large boobs]
[turns to address Cartman] Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree. [the scenario begins. A view into the bedroom from the tree at night] He would have watched Sarah with her doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife. [a hand appears, then the opposite hand with a knife. The knife cuts the first hand as Sarah drops her doll on the bedroom floor] The pain gave him sick pleasure.
[approaches the boy] Hey, kid, what are you doing?
Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!
Aw crap!
Son of a bitch stupid FBI!
No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that little girl's doll before those FBI guys do.
We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.
[behind the booth] They've gotten really good at this good-cop bad-cop thing.
It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.
[rushing up with Kyle and Kenny] Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!
[in hushed tones] Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down! [Kenny turns and rings the bell. Inside, Bill and Fosse stop their play and go to the door]
South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!
I don't know.
Dude, we just can't tell on them.
Jesus! They're gonna kill her!
[he and the others approach the FBI kids] Hey, you butt-holes can't play FBI here!
We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.
Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!
We go get the doll ourselves.
That's right. [cocks his left hand] But they didn't say anything about going in the back.
[pops up from the couch and fires away, using the back of the couch as a shield] Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse!
Did so!
[getting the doll after he, Kyle and Kenny approach the chair] We got it.
Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?
We do what we can, sir.
Sure.
I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama. [they turn and walk towards a large building in the distance]
Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?
Damn.
Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-
[softly] We just wanna be junior detectives.
It'll get better, guys.
[puts his soap away] Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time into it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?
I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?
You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. I'll see you guys at school tomorrow.
Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.
No thanks.
Thanks.
...I think I have a better idea.
[walks up with one of his outfits] Yes, I have a suit I need dry-cleaned, and pressed, please.
Red Man's Greed
Wow, dude.
Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. [begins to reminisce]
[stops reminiscing, turns around, and walks back to the boys] We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans!
We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!
We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! [the boys start thinking]
We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!
Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!
Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!
No!
I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!
Look, we- we've got nothing to lose.
Dad. [Randy turns around] Good luck.
[begins to wish hard] Come on! Come on! [the dealer starts the wheel and tosses the ball in the opposite direction. Everyone looks on in anticipation. The ball slows down and settles in on thirty one black.]
They, they had it! They freakin' had it!
You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.
A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!!
What???
You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans! [Randy brakes the car angrily]
[walks up to Randy, who is in line with the others] Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!
[walks with his friends to a clearing where he could be heard] Come on, you guys! This is our town!
We can stay. And fight.
Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now! [the adults look back helplessly] Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! [the boys leave. Cartman stays behind.]
No! We won't let you destroy our town!
Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.
Stan
It's all right, dad.
[looks over] She's hanging in there. [looks at Randy again] Here, drink some beer. [Randy turns his head aside a bit so he can take a sip, then resets his head]
You're gonna be all right.
No, Dad, NO.
What can I do?
Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus!
Hey, my name's Stan, and I was-
Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?
An inward journey? That sounds kinda gay.
[disgusted] Ah! Oh, dude!
Dad! Dad!
Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS. [reaches into the bag and pulls out each item as he names it] Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.
Dude, who the hell are you?
South Park is Gay!
Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.
So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.
I know!
Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll.
You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend.
Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??
Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! [the boys excitedly pull Kyle along to South Park Mall]
The Broflovski house. Gerald and Sheila watch TV from their couch
Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!
All right. Let's work it! [shimmies a bit. The boys turn and pass through the entrance, but stop in their tracks.] What the...?
Hey Craig.
These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!
Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!
We're metrosexual!!
Dude! W-what are you doing?
We're not straight! You're straight!
Wow, is that from Origins?
Well, what can we do about it?
What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.
Yeah. Wait, what?
[returns with Cartman and Kenny] Hey, what's goin' on?
Wow, we look great!
You'd better shut up, Craig.
It is not!
Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!
South Park, day. A Metrosexual Pride Parade moves down the street in the background, and News 4 is covering it.
Sharon
Linda
Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?
Yeah. It's cool, holmes.
Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. [turns and walks away]
Christian Rock Hard
Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band. [Cartman straightens up]
Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. [Cartman paces the floor with arms behind his back]
See what?
I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!
Hey dude.
No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!
You got a computer?
See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!
Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.
What the hell is that?
Butters
[apologetically] We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!
The FBI building, next day. The parents have shown up to retrieve the boys.
Boy, I'll say!
[walks off in the opposite direction] Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.
Oh yeah.
It is?? [Kyle's jaw drops]
Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.
What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.
Cartman
Kyle's house, day. The MOOP boys are still sitting on the steps, sulking, striking.
[sighs] Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.
[awed] Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy!
Announcer
I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.
What??
Is this for real?? This is for real!
[joins Kyle and faces the crowd] Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. [shots of Rick James, Ozzy, Britney and two other acts.]
So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'em?
I thought albums win either gold or platinum.
Hm. Guess he got what he deserved.
Grey Dawn
Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?
But they kill people.
I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.
What is that?
I think so.
What is he saying?
Oh! [drops his hockey stick and holds his hands to his face]
Dad, I'm scared.
I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!
Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving.
Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.
What's that?
The American Association of Retired Persons.
Hey Dad.
Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?
No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?
All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here [south entrance] and here [west entrance]. The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.
Yeah, I remember hearing about that.
All right!
We did it! [Cartman is finished and the others look at him like he's crazy]
...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.
Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!
Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.
And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.
[to his friends] Dude, I hate my family. [looks down embarrassed and walks away]
Casa Bonita
Dude, I wonder where Kyle is.
Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.
[stands up] What's Casa Bonita?
Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.
Yeah, it's kinda weird.
Yeah.
Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. [exits]
Really?
Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.
I knew he'd turn up.
Cartman, stop it!
All About Mormons
Yeah, screw that kid!
Well, maybe he won't fight.
All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. [leaves]
No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass.
I'm gonna kick your ass... [glances back] bitch.
[off guard] Huh?
Dude, stop it.
Shut up, Butters!
I'm... [stares back at Gary] going over to his house for dinner tonight.
[stammering] He's a really nice kid.
What's that?
No.
The kids
The... Book of Mormon? What's that?
Who's Joseph Smith? [they laugh at his ignorance]
No!
Blacksmith
Butler
Smith
Back to the present.
What happened then? [a small timer rings]
No, I was supposed to be home at eight.
...Hello?
[a few seconds later] Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?
The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.
That's not what the Harrisons said.
The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.
They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?
But that's just you and your friends.
Mr. Harrison said that I should be following Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.
Yeah.
The Marsh house. Sharon and Shelly are at their spots, Stan sits on the couch, all three watch TV. Randy returns with a Book of Mormon in hand.
See? That's what happened to me!
That's what they made me think, too!
Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.
What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.
Wow, you made this?
Uh, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... [a car horn is heard]
[fumbling about] Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.
[turns right and walks. Gary walks alongside] Yeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.
What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?
Yeah, but... how?
The Marsh house, night. At the dining table they're playing the same board game the Harrisons were playing a few nights before: "LIVING".
Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?
It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.
But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.
[with reservations] Hey Gary.
Dad!
Yeah.
Harris
Harris
Harris
...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?
No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?
No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translations were hidden!
[crosses his arms] I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!
Oh, stop it! [stands up] That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!
I'm not hanging around that kid anymore.
You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.
Oh brother.
I don't?
Butt Out
Kyle
Butt Out! Man 3
[Rolls eyes] Ugh, Jesus Christ! [Cartman has his hands buried in his face]
Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. [takes a cigarette from Kyle's pack, lights up, and puffs]
...Whoops.
Mom... [Randy holds her tight] Dad, it was just a-
What??
Yeah, what's the problem?
Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.
Young Worker
Older Worker
Factory workers
Kevin Harris
Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.
Huh?
Yeah, maybe you're right. [Cartman walks out and catches up to the others]
What are you doing, Cartman?
[pushes away from the table] Well, get away from us then.
Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!
Daaaad!
Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us!
Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?
[yielding] Oh all right.
Why?
So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. [all the boys stroke their chins]
Yup.
It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!
Well, I guess we learned our lesson.
Raisins
All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third "set hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.
Football.
Okay. 23! [Bebe appears behind him and taps him on the shoulder] Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! [Bebe taps him on the shoulder again. Stan turns and looks at her]
What? [looks let down]
[moves forth to hold her up] Oh whoa, wait a minute. [Bebe turns around] What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks. [This gets the other boys' attention]
Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?
'Cause I need to know why she broke up.
[pleading] Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?
What? That's no answer! [nudges him a bit] Go tell her to be more direct with me.
Kyle, this is my life. [points at Jimmy] Jimmy!
Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?
Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her, [thinks] tell her... [gestures] she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me.
She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.
Well?
[softly] Over? [walks away dejected. He's next seen in bed, a blanket hung across his window blocking out the outside light. He has his sheets drawn up tight against his chin. A few moments later, Kyle enters with Butters, Cartman, Jimmy and Kenny. Kyle studies his friend.] Jesus...
[softly, creaking] ...Go away.
Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?
You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...
Can we go, please?
No, dude, I feel worse!
Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!
I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! [turns and opens one of the doors]
Something I should have done a long time ago. [walks out the door and into the night]
Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now! [Bebe rolls her eyes and sighs] All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!
[thinks] Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?
[with emotion in his voice] I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.
Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.
But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?
All right, so how do I join you?
...'K.
Pete
[dressed all in black, with a black hat with puffball] Yeah.
[takes up his paper and reads his poem]
Henrietta
[continues]
Pete
They're not?
Well I don't drink coffee.
[sips some coffee] Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. [sips some coffee. Pete jerks his hair back into place]
So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.
What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?
Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?
[sips some coffee] ...conformist.
Butters?
What's the matter with you?
Huh? But you just got dumped.
No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.
He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. [walks off]
Kyle
[arrives] Hey, can I join in? [the other boys turn around]
Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way. [Token and Wendy walk by at this point] Hey Wendy! [Token and Wendy look] You're a bitch,.. Token? [flips him off] Right here, buddy. [Token and Wendy walk off, insulted]
Yeah. Let's play ball.
It's Christmas in Canada
Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.
Sure dude.
Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?
Dude, Cartman.
Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. [he, Cartman and Kenny leave. Cartman stops and returns]
[trying to rein in his dad's enthusiasm] Dad, don't get carried away.
Whoa whoa, Cartman.
Cartman, calm down!
It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined.
Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.
No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?
What's going on??
Do something, Kyle! [Kyle grabs the controls and tries to steer the plane]
You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. [As they look in one direction, four Canadians pop up from some bushes and look at them. They drop back into the bushes before the boys turn back around]
Road Workers
All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!
I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.
Mime
Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.
Mime
What?
What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.
[grimacing] Oh no!
And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure. [sits between the two of them]
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
What is that?
Stan

Oh my God, look! [the other boys turn and walk up] Martial arts weapons from the Far East. [the sign reads "Martial arts weapons of the Far East"]
Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.
Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought. [the boys turn back to face the table] I'll get the tonfas. [they look like the nightsticks police use, but made of wood] Those are so sweet.
Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.
We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.
Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.
[with his tonfa] Kiya! Kiya!
[sweeps one of his tonfa around and transforms] With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like.
What's your ninja name, Kenny?
All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!
Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go. [they walk off and approach Craig's house, which is done up in Japanese style. Stan stops and whispers] All right, this is it.
Ninja positions! [the boys get into their first positions and Craig opens the door] Hello, Craig!
We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.
Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.
Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. [turns and walks away]
Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! [Butters shows up before them]
Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys. [the boys turn and walk off] We have a lot of work to do.
Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.
Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!
Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!
I dunno. Craig, is that you?
[steps forth] Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa! [Stan strikes a battle pose and unleashes the energy from the tonfa tips. Butters shields himself with his cape, and the tonfa energy dissipates. Butters cackles] Hey kid, that knocks you down.
Yeah, huh, I got you!
Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!
[he and Kyle rush over to Butters] Butters! Oh my God! [the boys gather around Butters] Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!
[tries to soothe Butters] Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.
Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! [Butters composes himself and sobs softly, looking around from time to time for any sign of help]
Dude, shut up!
What?!
Just stay still, Butters.
God dammit!
We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?
He's really old and going blind.
We might pass him off as our pet.
All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.
All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.
[looks off to his left] Okay, it's clear. [turns right and walks on. Cartman and Kyle escort Butters between them]
Oh shit, somebody's coming!
Where'd you get those?
Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going.
Guys, we're we're really not playing, okay? [Jimmy has already transformed and leaps into the air, twirling his kali sticks around, and lands in a powerful pose]
We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah! [He begins his attack. The other boys move forth and the fight begins, as a song reminiscent of Japanese anime theme songs, mostly Japanese with occasional English words, starts playing; its lyrics appear as a sing-along along the bottom of the screen.]
The fight as the song progresses: Jimmy twirls his kali sticks around and aims them at Stan, unleasing two beams of energy. Stan blocks them with his tonfa. Kenny watches Craig be tossed through the air. Token sweeps his nunchucks around and unleases energy towards Kenny, who jumps clear and lets Cartman take the blow. Cartman shatters it with his sai swords. The nunchucks sweep back. Kenny falls to the ground on his ass, behind Cartman. Token attacks Cartman with his nunchucks, but Cartman counters them with his sais, sending Token flying back a few yards. Token rubs his right shoulder. Clyde whips out his kamas and whips them around, and Kyle responds by whipping his nunchucks around. Clyde focuses on Kyle and unleashes a large amount of energy from his kamas. Craig and his crew are shown, then Craig and Kenny fly at each other. Stan takes a stand. Two silhouettes fight. A car rolls by the scene slowly, and the driver simply observes. He sees them are they are, then drives off. The scene reverts to anime letterbox and the boys continue fighting
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait! [the song ends, and he looks around] Wait. [steps forward] Hold on a second. Where's Butters? [sees the open oven door, and no one in the oven]
[turns and faces Craig's boys] Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him!
No dude, you gotta help us find him!
Butters!
Butters!
Bad.
Nothing, just... playing.
Butters!
What?
Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.
It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them.
All right, the county fair's still open! [they spot Roger, shown in anime form, and approach his booth.]
We have come to return the weapons we purchased.
What is it, Craig?
Come on, Ninjas! [the boys make their way across the fairgrounds, but freeze in their tracks upon seeing the auction]
Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.
[softly] Good luck, Bulrog. [Cartman leaves, with only his footsteps indicating where he's going]
Oh, Jesus.
What?
Just run with it, dude.
Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.
[he and Kenny pull out their weapons] Yeah. Come on, ninjas. [they transform into their anime forms] We've got some more work to do.
Up the Down Steroid
Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.
Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.
So?
That's really, really terrible, dude.
The Passion of the Jew
Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated.
Things seem pretty quiet.
Oh God, here we go again.
That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.
Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now.
[rises] Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.
Dude. That movie sucked.
How can they even call that a movie?
That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.
Hey, we want our money back.
That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.
That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!
You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!
W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! [he and Kenny storm off]
Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go. [clicks on the link] Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.." Okay, okay, wait, here we go. [picks up the phone and dials in]
Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.
No, no, no, no, we want our money back.
We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!
I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!
Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!
[in recognition] Wait a minute. Cartman?! [realizing he's been recognized, Cartman is speechless]
[packing] Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!
We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible! [He leads Kenny out of his room] This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!
Thank you. [looks over his Map To The Stars' Homes] This must be the place. [they walk through a side door right under a guard's nose. He fails to notice them. They walk up the driveway and past the massive fountain] Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. [rings the doorbell. The door opens and Mel appears]
Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny.
Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?
Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.
Tor- torture you?
We don't want to torture you.
Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?
Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude! [catches a glimpse of a wallet on a table] Wait! There's his wallet! [runs up to it with Kenny]
Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? [Kenny hands Stan $2]
All right, let's get the hell out of here! [heads for the doors and opens one. Mel dances in wearing a Carmen Miranda outfit. Stan and Kenny head for another pair of doors. Stan opens it and Mel enters dressed as a clown]
Aah! Run, dude, run!
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson. [net loss, sixty-nine dollars] But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
Oh, you've got to be shittin' me. [Mel Gibson closes in fast in his Mad Max gas truck and wearing Braveheart face paint]
Goddamn, that guy's crazy. [hops off his seat and runs up to the driver] Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.
Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- [Mel plows into the bus, making both vehicles screech. The riders sway in their seats]
Yeah. I told you that!
He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.
He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.
It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!
No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.
You Got F'd in the A
Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. [some kids come up behind Stan]
OC Leader
Chef, we just got served.
Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-
Some, kids from Orange County.
No.
But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.
But Dad-
[carrying the car] Yeah, let's go race it right now![they run into the OC kids]
Black Man
What?
I thought I was supposed to!
But why?
I, I don't know. He seems all right.
[walks to Randy's bedside] Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad.
Okay, good.
[thinks and then walks off miffed] God dammit!
Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?
Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?
Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.
[walks up to the red Goth] Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?
Great! [they leave together]
All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.
The arcade?
Dude, he's incredible.
[catches up to Yao at the change machine] Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?
Yeah.
[catches up] Dude, we need you.
It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.
All right, that's three!
Huh?
Oh yeah. [thinks a bit with finger to chin] Wait a minute. I know just where to go!
Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.
And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.
So you'll do it?
All right, we just need one more person!
What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?
Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean...
Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.
It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. [his smile vanishes as he begins to think back, then a small grimace appears.]
But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.
We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.
Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?
A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.
All right, so you're sure he can dance?
The duck rises and begins to dance.
Stan
Stan
As the song reaches its climax, he dances faster and faster, until his right shoe flies off his foot.
Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.
Chef
We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?
Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- [the others also speak, the others continue to argue, talking over one another.]
I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.
Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.
Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault.
Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.
Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.
And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
But that isn't the point, Butters! [Butters resumes building his tiny town] The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying "Haha! I'm better than you!" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.
[Firmly] Fine. [walks to the door and opens it] But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. [leaves and closes the door. Butters, angered, tosses some blocks into his town, then wipes the town off the desk.]
What?
What happened??
Aw, what do we do, Chef?!
Butters! [the SP crew moves towards him]
The OC leader comes up to Butters and serves him with a balance act on the right hand twice and a back flip, then returns to the crew, spins on his head a few times, then ends on his side, resting his head on his right hand.
The music begins a brief instrumental. The Diggitys answer the serve with a sequence that has the members twirling and handing off to the next one until all point to Butters. He then steps forth tap-dancing. He dances well, but his dancing gets intense quickly.
Butters' intensity is so great that his left shoe flies off his foot and sails into the rafters.
All right Butters!
AWESOM-O
They're walking along in a meadow. Butters is telling him a story.
Butters has AWESOM-O take shots at a basketball hoop. The shot is good and Butters is pleased.
Stan, Kyle and Kenny observe nearby from behind a bush. They're dismayed at what they see. Stan pinches his nose and shuts his eyes in frustration, then walks off. Kyle and Kenny follow.
Butters jumps in a puddle, then has AWESOM-O do the same. Butters giggles.
Butters washes dishes while AWESOM-O dries them, then they go see "The Prince and Me." They exit, with Butters skipping beside AWESOM-O.
At a restaurant two burgers reach Butters' table. He gets one, he motions to the waiter that AWESOM-O doesn't need the other one. The waiter looks confused, then walks away with the other burger.
Butters has AWESOM-O pull him along in a red wagon.
They walk into a sunset together.
Butters' house, living room. His dad reads the newspaper, his mom arrives with coffee and cookies and sets them down on the coffee table.
Cartman
Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool.
Catamount Pictures. Butters and Cartman walk around. Cartman carries the bags.
Butters
As the video plays, shots are shown of: the fourth graders and the kindergartners, more fourth graders and older students (including Stan, Kyle, and Kenny), Chef, Principal Victoria, Mr. Garrison, other teachers, Butters enjoying himself immensely, the Catamount Pictures producers, the military, then of a fuming Cartman having to suffer it all as everyone laughs.
The Jeffersons
[stops and looks at a house] Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. [the other boys stop and look.]
What's that you're wearing?
Whoa. Dude, no way!
Dude, are these all your toys?
[softly] Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.
Kyle
Stark's Pond, day. A group of kids skate around lazily on its frozen surface. Stan and friends race over a rise towards the lake.
Hey, you guys! You guys! [the kids gather around] You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!
Cartman
I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.
Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
Fine, Mom.
No, my parents are.
What?
[looks out] Kyle?
Mr. Jefferson Awww! [hops off the bed] It's 1:30 in the morning!
Michale raises himself up on his tippy-toes.
Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!
He just showed up here.
Jesus Christ!
I know. He's here.
No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.
Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!
Cartman
Ahaa!
Yeah. A really bad dream.
Oh Jesus!
You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!
Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there.
Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.
Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.
Stop, you fucking lunatic! [Mr. Jefferson's moustache falls off and down to the ground, he pulls Blanket back inside and closes the window]
You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.
Blanket, you in here?
All right dude, get in his bed.
Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. [hops off and leaves]
Go, go, ruuun! [the boys run out of the bathroom]
[The boys enter Blanket's room] Oh Jesus!
Oh my God, he killed Kenny!
Run, Blanket, Run!

Goobacks
Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?
Cartman, just keep your mouth shut.
Whoa.
Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!
Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.
Night, Mom. [after she leaves, he puts his arms up and behind his head and smiles] Wow, two people from the future. How cool.
Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?
All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. [the boys turn to go back to the sidewalk...]
Son of a bitch!
[pipes up] It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too! [silence] Oh, they took our jobs!
I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' to- [an immigrant descends the stairs with a basket of dirty clothes and stops to ask Sharon something using guttural sounds]
[leery] Who is that?
Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!
Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.
I wanted my job!
Timecist?
People from the future. Right, got it.
That's right! [other students speak up]
Can you speak in present-day English please?
Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.
[getting annoyed] No, a double cheeseburger and fries!
What?!
I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!
No, it's not a chicken sandwich! [his parents enter the restaurant and stand in line behind him and the boys] I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!
Aw- awwww!
Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?
I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us. [loosens up and opens his eyes] They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. [the mound of men stops copulating]
I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work.
Cartman
We're doing it!
Stan
Okay, sorry, my bad, everyone back in the pile. [everyone races back to the pile. The men take off their clothes]
Douche and Turd
Red
But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!
This is bullcrap, dude!
Dude, I really don't care. [walks away]
[exiting] Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?
I'm not voting!
I just think this whole thing is stupid! [walks off angrily]
It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.
Mom, I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.
Puff Daddy?
I...
"Vote or Die"? [upset] What the hell does that even mean?!
Aaaah!
Puff Daddy
Posse
Overhead shot of Puff Daddy, dressed in a white suit, then in a black suit.
At a polling station encouraging one female voter.
Stan runs until he sees a passageway between two buildings. He does in to try to escape, but Puff Daddy and his crew find him.
Puff Daddy
Puffy is seated in an armchair wearing a wig, surrounded by women, all in front of a Vegas-style sign saying "DIDDY"
Raps to a chrome reflection.
Puff Daddy
Stan
I guess... [P Diddy and his posse look on from one end of the polling station, with P cocking his gun]
Okay. [finishes up and seals his ballot, then walks away]
I'm voting.
Yeah, I know.
[annoyed] I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.
Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!
Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!
The whole thing is a joke!
B-bani-banishment?
You-you're all joking, right?
I'm not voting! [Kyle then steps forth and repeats what the others did before him]
Dad, isn't this a little extreme?
Hello? [the people gather round and remove the pail]
Oh, thank God.
Awww!
What about me?
I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.
Wow, you guys really love animals.
I'll live with you.
He said I can stay.
Ahh, no thanks, that's okay.
I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.
I can't. I was banished for not voting.
I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
I guess... I guess you're right. [casts his eyes down and to the left in reflection. An arm appears, with a gun at the end aimed at Stan]
[jumps] Aaah!
[braves his way through the crossfire, but gets hit on his left shoulder] Aaaah!! [keeps moving]
I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.
Mr. Mackey
Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!
Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes
...What?
It's time for what?
Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?
Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. [Kyle turns, and the three remaining boys walk away.]
Butters? [more strange noises come from Butters' mouth]
Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town. [the boys turn and leave.]
Dad? [looks around at all the stuff] Jesus Christ, Da-dad! Dad?!
Dad, oh my God!
What? D-dad, are are you dying?
But you-your face!
Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.
Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their- [knocks over his glass of milk, which spills onto Shelly]
But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-
Dad!
Dad, what are you doing?!
Dad, you're a geologist!
Where are they?
Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please.
Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. [he and Kenny head for the doors]
Dude, come on!
Dude, we have to go!
Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman!
Goddamn, that took a long time.
Where's he?
There has to be a way!
Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?
No, dude, don't! [Mr. Brown shoots himself through the temple and falls over on his left side, dead. Seconds later he craps through his pants, leaving a hole in them and a fallen bar stool nearby. A few moments of shock, and then Cartman cracks up]
Save it, Grandpa!
Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.
One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.
What?!
Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! [the three make their way to the back, but Randy can't help but look at all the bargains]
Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?! [looks around, then turns to his right. Kyle turns to his left. Both boys see Randy] Dad!
Come on, Dad!
No, dad! We need your keys!
[passing the candy display] There! The television department!
You?
We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.
Me. I'm asking the question.
Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart?
It's a mirror.
Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart. [the boys turn and face the mirror again, and Kyle takes a black mallet to it. It shatters.]
Dad, come on! We've gotta get out!
Pre-School
Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!
[pulls Kyle away] Right now, goddamnit!
[the look of fear is strong on his face] Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. [the boys are suddenly afraid]
Yeah! He just got paroled!
What the hell are we gonna do??
Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.
Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.
Wow, cool!
[walks up to the crumples sheet] Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang! [drops his pants and begins pissing on the paper] Come on, firemen! Put out the fire! [the other boys come and imitate the fire truck noises while pissing on the paper. Trent looks on.]
We're heroes!
Put it out, put it out! [Cartman runs up to their teacher and starts pissing on her. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny follow suit]
Dude, we are in so much trouble!
That's true.
No!
Yeah, who cares?
Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.
Sshhh, here comes Ms. Claridge now. [a soft noise is heard, and in rolls a futuristic wheelchair, encasing Ms. Claridge]
[nervously] Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge? [a yellow button on the machine lights up and beeps. She turns left and rolls away]
Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.
I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on! [the boys run off]
Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.
We've come to... ask you for help.
Yeah.
What?!
Dude, weak!
[after some thought] No!
You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.
But mom, my teacher will-
[normal] But Mo-o-o-
This is hopeless!
That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!
No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.
How do you know?!
All right, fine. [draws some nipples on Cartman's ass, checking the book to be sure. He then steps back]
Excuse me!
[steps forward] We, we got it. [pulls out the photo. The sixth graders ride up to the boys]
Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?
Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing? [she's still in the crosswalk] Ms. Claridge?
Dude, what happened?
What's that?
We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.
No, no, we've just gotta find better help.
[looks down] There is... one person.
Shelly?
Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.
Shelly [hesitates, begins to tear up] Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left. [begins to cry. Shelly notices, puts her bowl aside, hops off the sofa, and walks up to Stan]
Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.
We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!
Admit it was our fault?
Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you. [no reply]
See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was "Fireman."
Trent, look: We've realized our mistake! [Trent advances, the boys back up]
What is that?
Yeah, who cares?
Quest for Ratings
Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?
[returning from the kitchen to serve as cameraman] And we're... cut! [turns off the camera]
Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.
...Craig's show??
But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!
Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.
[look at Cartman, but notices someone else] Hey, look, Craig just walked in. [Craig enters to cheers from the other kids in the restaurant and waves back to them. Several kids take pictures of Craig]
Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! [holds up a fist with thumb and index finger just a centimeter apart]
[The flashback ends] Ah whatever, Kenny! [walks away]
Craig
Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!
Come on, guys! [the boys leave]
All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.
Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good.
We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...
Good!
All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!
Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused.
Then, let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade.
No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.
I knew we could do it!
Craig's new show?
Hey wha-b-but we gave it our best.
[stunned] I don't believe it.
Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!
Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?
Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on! [time passes. Stan begins to pace the floor again] How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh.
Crab people?
[looks at Cartman, then gets annoyed] Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.
We're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas.
Cartman
Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine.
I guess we'll just take all of 'em.
It's... it's the greatest show of all time.
You guys. You guys, wake up! [the boys are roused]
We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.
You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long.
No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now. [strokes his chin] I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!
[voice over] They're doing it in the hallways! [a shot of Tweek downing some cough syrup, then jumping in surprise with his iconic yelp and running away] Behind the school! [a shot of the Goth kids downing cough medicine]
Even in the girls' bathroom! [a shot of Bebe and Red in the restroom viewed through an air vent. Bebe takes a sip from a bottle of cough medicine, gives it to Red to sip, then notices something in the air vent]
[a shot of Jimmy and Principal Victoria looking at the report] We showed the shocking footage to the principal!
The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: riddled their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free. [a shot of the hallways from the entrance. All the kids are coughing and walking around. Some of them sneeze]
[knowingly] Gee, what a coincidence.
Nobody has any ideas?
...Bail. [everyone leaves the table]

Oh, thank God.

Cartman's Incredible Gift
Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. [Cartman is shown at the edge of the roof wearing wings made from cardboard]
It's not gonna work; just come down from there.
Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. [Kyle looks up to see what the others see. Cartman looks down]
[to Kenny] He's not gonna do it.
Cartman
Liane
Kyle
Liane
Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!
[under his breath] Butters, Goddammit.
[a few moments later, sighs] Call an ambulance.
Woodland Critter Christmas
A nearby forest. The camera pans down from the sky and rest upon a Christmas tree. Forest animals gather round and decorate it.
Narrator
Stan
The forest. The critters approach Stan.
It's... nice.
Okay, okay.
Critters
[doesn't smile] Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home. [turns around, picks up the reins on his sled and walks off]
Woof.
Oh, whatta? [squeezes his eyelids shut]
Stan
[sighs] You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.
...What?
The forest. Stan has built the manger and is hammering the last few nails in place.
Rabbity
Stan
Go away! Shoo! [The lion moves off and the critters return.]
Again?
Stan
Stan
The cave entrance. Stan sees that the mountain lion is motionless and approaches.
Okay, there. [three lion cubs approach the entrance]
[at a loss for words] I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? [The cubs snuggle close to their mom's body, sobbing.]
Stan
It's dead.
I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.
Wait, wha-what?
Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!
But I thought you meant the Son of God!
Squirrely
Stan
Stan
Stan
Stan
All right, all right, all right! God! [He turns off the TV, hops off the sofa and walks out the door, leaving the remote control on the floor.]
I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!
No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist! [walks off] I came here to put a stop to all this!
Right, whatever. [turns around] I'm taking down the manger I built. [Beary's eyes turn red and brighten. A wall of hellfire appears before Stan.] Ah! [The wall gets higher.] Aaaah! [All the critters' eyes are flashing a bright red. Black crows swoop down and attack Stan.] Aagh! Aaaahh! [A two-headed demon dog appears snarling at him; he runs off in terror.] AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! [The critters' eyes revert back to normal.]
Stan
Hello? Anybody in there? [the three cubs appear at the entrance of the cave]
Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.
I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!
Well, you're mountain lions.
There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.
Stan
Stan
No, he didn't!
No, he didn't!
Oh, Goddammit! [the doctor and patient are startled]
I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.
Narrator
Montage. The doctor puts on his gloves and the cubs peer into the patient's vagina. Stan peers in as well, from a distance. The doctor works away happily and cleans up well. The patient leaves, and the next one is worked on. Lion cub 2 is on a desk next to a bottled fetus. He hops off, knocking the bottle off as well. The bottle pops open and the fetus falls out. Everyone turns and sees the fetus on the floor, and laugh about it. The doctor works on the next patient and Lion cub 3 brings him some forceps. The doctor smiles and strokes the cub's head. The other two cubs snuggle up to the patient on her shoulders, and she smiles at them.
Stan
Beary
Squirrely
Stan
The critters are standing around the manger. A grotesque creature lies in the cradle.
Stan
It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!
[turns to the lion cubs] That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! [Skunky, Squirrely, Beary, and Chickadee-y walk over to get Kyle. Santa's sleigh appears in the sky.]
Beavery
I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!
Dude, what the- ? [Squirrely activates his demon power with the red glow from his eyes and a wall of hellfire appears before Santa.]
[goes to untie Kyle from the altar] Come on, dude. [Santa continues firing at the remaining critters. Porcupiney is blown apart, then Foxy.]
What?! Kyle?!
Dude!
No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.
Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.
No Santa, don't!
Stan
I took them to see how abortions are done.
Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Narrator
The lion cub 3 is deep in Kyle's ass, retrieving the Antichrist with his teeth. He succeeds and takes it to Santa quickly. Santa takes it and sets it down on a tree stump. Santa grabs a large sledgehammer next to the stump, raises it over his head, and bring it down upon the Antichrist, smashing it to bits with a loud THUD.
[smiles] Yeah. Yeah, there is.
[relieved] Oh, good.
A shot of the town, receding from view.
