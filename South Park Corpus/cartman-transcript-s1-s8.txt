I know what it means!
I'm not telling you.
He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right! [Kyle swings Ike by his feet, knocking Cartman down.] Ow! [Ike Laughs.]
That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.
Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed...
...in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room.
Then slowly my bedroom door began to open... [A Visitor peeks inside.]
...and then the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway.
Weeaak!
Then I was lying on a table...
...and these scary aliens wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes.
What?
No, it was just a dream, my mom said so.
Oh, shut up guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working.
Kick ass.
[Surprised.] Huh?
Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned!
Oh!
Oh!
No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that?
No!
Shut up, dildo!
Oh!
God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!
Shut up!
Shut up you guys, it's not working.
Heh, somebody's baking brownies.
[Embarrassed.] Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh.
Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you.
Ow! My ass!
[Cartman farts fire again.] Uh... Ow! My ass!
No, that was just a dream.
No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine.
[Cartman farts fire.] Oh!! Whoa, I sure am hungry.
Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature.
[Singing.] Stan wants to ki-iss Wendy Testabur-ger.
I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.
Or slip her the tongue.
You are making it up.
What?
[Turning to face Chef, testily.] Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh?
Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak!
Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..!
I would if I could, you son of a bitch!
Uh—Would you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control!
I love to singa,
Ah, son of a bitch!
You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control.
Uh...
Hey...
Ow! [Faces Kyle.] That hurts, you buttlicker!
No!
He's not dead.
Shut up, you guys.
God damn it, I didn't have an anal probe! [He walks off.] Screw you guys, I'm goin' home.
[Off screen.] Dildo!
Hi, Mom.
Well, I'm pissed off!
I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!
That's what I said.
No!
No, leave me alone mom! [He walks past her.]
[He stops in his tracks.] What? Well, that does sound pretty good.
Uh, Mom?
If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay?
Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs.
Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck.
No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie.
No, Kitty, you bad kitt--!
No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!
Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!
[Confused.] What?
No, Kitty, you can't have any!
No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie! Bad Kitty--!
Eh, 'scuse me, Kitty.
Dude, weak mom.
I can't, my mom said...
[Quietly.] But mom, I don't want to spend time with my little friends--
God damn it!
You guys, I have to get home.
Oh, man, this sucks.
[Cartman farts fire.] Ow!
Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
I don't wanna.
Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!
I'm sick of it! It's completely immature.
You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up.
Sure, you guys, what-ever.
You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens!
Oh, God damn it!
What the hell are they talking about?
You guys, get me down from here!
Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos!
Puh!
Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night.
Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there was... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.
[Sarcastically.] Oh right, [Matter of factly.] why don't I have pinkeye then?
Ahh, son of a bitch!
Ugh, I hate those things.
Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like: "EHY! GET OUT OF MY ASS YOU STUPID RAINBOWS!" [Silence.]
I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!
Ohh, rainbows. Oh yeah, I like those, those are cool.
Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it.
Nothing..!
What?
Kick ass!
Yeah I do, pop tarts are frosted.
Oh, you know, this and that.
There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.
Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?
You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous.
Hey!
That kid is me.
Me! Eric Cartman!
Yes ma'am. [Sings.]
[Still singing.]
Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish.
Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.
If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?
Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!
I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.
Screw you, hippie!
Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.
Yes!
Beefcake!
Beefcake!
Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000?
But mom, I need it for tomorrow.
[Shrieking.] Mm-mo-om, Ah-ee née-eed suh-ome Weight Gain Four Thousaaand! I need iiit!
Hey dudes.
Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?
I'm up to 94, thank you very much.
Laugh all you want, I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff.
Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up.
Ey! I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!
Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh.
Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.
I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!
No they don't, you jealous weakling!
Hey!
Oh look, another hippie.
Peace, Wendy.
Oooh,
...K I S S I N G. First comes the baby and...
This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!
Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame.
You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eihh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.
Cartman, God damn it.
Here it is, my big moment of fame.
Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?
[Whining.] But I won the environmental essay contest.
When is this going to be on the air?
Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!
Okay, Mom.
Dude, that's sick mom.
Drive, Drive!
Drive the car damn-it, drive!
Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing.
You piece of crap, I'll kill you!
Eeeeenh!
Hey, I didn't get a gun.
Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam
Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off.
My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.
Democrats piss me off!
Kickass!!
Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks.
Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!
I got your back, soldier.
Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything.
I can shoot you too!
I'll fill you full of lead!
My weenies won't cook.
Hey you guys, this works pretty good right meah.
Heh, tha-that's not scary.
Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!
Hey, you would taste my pee!
Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of [He turns his flashlight on his face for dramatic effect.] Scuzzlebutt?
Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.
Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.
Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has...
No! A piece of celery.
Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy.
What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step? [Silence.] So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tashink ...tashink ...tashink.
Hey, it might be!
Screw you guys! ...Go to Hell!
They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of 'em tomorrow!
I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.
[To himself.] Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.
Holy crap!
What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Hey, wait, aah!
You guys, it's just me.
Eh, gotta get out of this stupid costume.
You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!
Hey, seriously you guys!
Hey!
Goddammit, don't shoot me!
I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.
Help!
What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
Yeah, cartoons kick ass! [All three leave.]
Eh. You're making me sick, dude.
No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
Oh yeah? Let's see. Hey, Sylvester!
I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
Huh. He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.
Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.
That dog is a gay homosexual.
Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo.
What's homecoming?
There he goes again.
Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.
Ah, dammit!
Eeyy!
Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-?
That's not fair!
Stupid puppet.
You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass.
Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.
Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen.
He still looks pretty gay to me.
There he goes!
No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote the sodomies in France.
Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!
Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants. [Stan punches him] Ow!
Did you check the shopping ma- [Stan punches him] Ow!
We'll just see about that.
No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
That's right, you get back there.
Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man.
Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?
Your sister beat you up again, huh?
Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.
I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried anything, I'd be like, "hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"
Be a man Stan. Just say, "Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies."
That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig. Cause its poop is small.
[Entering.] If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, "Hey, you go do my laundry and-"
[Stung.] Yes ma'am.
Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!
You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts. Kyle, Kyle no!
Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!
Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, "Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"
[A bit wary.] Well, looks like nobody's home. Guess we should come back some other time.
It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.
Baby?! Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!
Hey! I'm taking my pig and...Screw you guys! I'm going home! This whole idea's stupid anyway.
Hey! Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
I'll kick you in the nuts!
Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.
Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.
You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!
Come on Fluffy!
UUuuhh. I sure am hungry.
Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you!
God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?! Nobody gives a rat's ass.
Gah, French people piss me off.
Ugh!... Hey! I'll kick your ass!
Whaaat?!
I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.
Why? Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?
Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, "hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!"
I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.
No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig! You leave Fluffy out of this!
Kyle no, seriously. No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I... Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts.
Fluffy!
Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?
Hey!
I ain't helpin' crap! I want to eat some paeh.
Oh yeah, watch me. [Zips away.]
Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison.
That'll do pig.
Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!
That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!
That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!
Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!
[Tauntingly.] Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?
What?
Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!
Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal.
Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.
Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?
I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.
What!
Hey!
You piece of crap! I'll kill you!
Don't talk about my mom like that!
Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!
Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang.
Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!
Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer.
Oh, biiitch.
Your—mom—is--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh.
Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming.
Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again.
Hey, you're gonna miss it Kenny.
Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart.
I don't know.
Why don't we just shoot him?
Aaaah, runrunruuun!
Ehh, eh, ehhhh!
Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on.
You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!
Ohhh, God, No!
My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.
Yeah!
What the hell is that thing?
There's no such thing as UFOs.
Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass.
Hey, dudes.
It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil.
My mom made it, isn't it cool?
What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody?
Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool.
Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off!
Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage.
I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!
I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung!
Poor piece of crap.
There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?
You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
[In a mocking voice.] Wookies don't live on Endor.
What?! What did you say?
Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding? [As Kenny.] No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like. [As himself.] Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you.
Eating Kenny's pudding.
Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself.
That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool.
My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!
Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o.
Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!
[Gleefully.] Could I see that again? That was cool.
I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.
[Whining.] I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost!
Boo! I'm a ghost.
Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad.
Hey Chef.
Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?
What is that?
Who?
Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him.
Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.
Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking.
God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!
Check.
Yeah, granola pisses me off.
Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny.
Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire.
I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!
I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate.
Hi Wendy.
You what?! Are you insane?!
How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?
Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy.
You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!
Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!
Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.
One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!
Can we have some candy now please?!
I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit!
Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!
Aaah!
It was Kyle.
Remember candy, focus on the candy.
Eh, shit...
You guys, shit...
It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!
Hey, there's a pay phone!
Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it!
Aaah, kew!
Finish her dude, she's a zombie now!
Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?
Kill her Stan!
Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on!
Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way.
Well, let's go home, start eating that candy.
Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money.
Lehh, eh, screw you guys!
Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.
And yeah, we want Cheesy Poofs!
Did you guys see that? That was sweet.
Yeah, HEY!
That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?
KICK ASS!!
When do we get the sports watch?
You vas-deferens!
I get to wear it first, you guys.
Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.
When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?
Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!
Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!
Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!
Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!
I get to use it first you guys! Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?
What the hell?
Yeah, Starvin' Marvin.
Hey mooom?
We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?
Sweet.
No no! He's my son! I adopted him.
Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.
Ahh!
Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.
Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?
You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.
This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.
Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers.
No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie.
Oh yeah, you're right.
Yeah, that's right.
No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.
No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!
Oh well, back to the poor country with you.
B-huh, huh. Yeah, right.
Hey, hey, what's going on?!
Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!
Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin!
Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!
I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!
Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere.
Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?
Well, screw you too!
What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?!
Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat.
Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!
I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.
What?!
But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!
WEEEEEEAK!!!
Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh...
I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh.
Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err.
Huh, I wonder what's in here?
SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!
Sally Struthers?!
Gimme that cake!
No Sally Struthers, you gimme that cake!
No Sally Struthers, that's my cake eh-ehhhh!
You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!!
That's right you will, God-Damnit.
Move it POVs, I'm an American!
Oohhhh!
Oh dude! Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!
I'm not fat, I'm festively plump.
What the hell is Christmas Poo?
Hey!
What the hell are you doing? Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!
Yeah. We'll see you later, Kyle. Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.
Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that.
Uh, Kyle? Come on, seriously? You are really reaching right now.
You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle.
Oh, boy! Super-bitch is at it again!
[stopping Kyle] Never mind him. He's a very disturbed little boy.
How do you know?
Yeah? Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting. The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000.
I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet.
Let me see!
Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?
Thanks to Kyle's mother.
How about we sing "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch", in D minor.
O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Monday she's a bitch,
Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom? 
Gross, Kyle!
YOU SICK BASTARD!
Bye, Kyle! Happy Channukah!
Well. Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it.
'Cause. He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.
Okay, that does it! Screw this, I'm goin home!
Talking poo is where I draw the line!
Good-bye Mr. Hankey! Bring me lots of presents! I always believed in you!
Yeah, something feels...unfinished.
Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...
They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday...
That's right.
That's ri-aayy.
[darting over] Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!
I shoved it up my ass!
Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!
Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde...
No, my birthday isn't until Saturday.
Eeeeeeh!
Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?
Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?
Byah. Oof!
[Getting up off the floor.] Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk!
Eheh. [Taunting.] You got in trouble, you got in trouble.
Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?
Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mom's cake, pie, and ice cream, then.
Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is.
Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!
Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.
Eeyy!
Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butt-hole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!
Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Chopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money...
Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!
Cartman's birthday!
You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.
Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!
Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.
[Sees Damien coming.] Oh, here comes the unholy butt-hole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!
[Farts and moves away.] Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice!
You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?
Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.
Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?
Yeah. Come on in and join the party. [Damien is pleased]
Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now. [Stan leaves.] And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy.[She leaves.] Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS?! [Thumps the table in anger.]
YOU SON OF A BITCH! [Lunges towards Kyle.]
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! [Slapping him around by now.]
I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!
Aah! AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That's it! Party is over!
Everybody go home!
GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT!
Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you!
Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
[still laughing] That is so-ho lame!
Oh man, I...
Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.
[Slowly.] Wow, she's pretty.
[Brightly.] Yes, ma'am.
Noh, he always pukes when he's in love.
She wasn't looking at you, butt-lord, she was looking at me!
Until you puked on her.
I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner, chicks like vacuum cleaners
[Eagerly.] Memememememe, me!
What's a multiplication table?
We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Grieco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while-
Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen.
Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!
[Enunciating.] Good-bye, Ms. Ellen.
I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut!
Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home.
Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell.
Nuh-uh!
Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!
Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass.
Oh, hi, Chef.
You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian.
I am, too!
My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.
This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!
I'm a bigger lesbian than you!
Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John.
Dang! That's nice!
Oh, weak, dude!
Did you make love?
No way!
That's not what we just heard!
What the hell...?
Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box.
Boooriing.
Day is never finished,
No, I found it.
No, I did, Pip.
Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it.
Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead.
Okay, ready? I'll go first.
Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it.
Day is never finished,
Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle!
Eeyy! Give me that back!
We'll ro-sham-bo for it!
ANTHROPOLOGIST!
I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!
[To Kyle.] Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it!
...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!
Screw you, triangle thief!
Eeyy!
Oh I'll find it, don't worry!
God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously.
I was just setting it aside.
Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do!
Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it.
Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him?
What's that noise?
Aaah! Aliens!
No! I found it, he stole it!
I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief.
Na-ah! She's being a total bitch!
[Revealing himself.] You scared the crap out of me, Ike!
I'm trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back?
Well, you can tell Kyle that he's a dirty goddamn son of a bitch!!
Huh?!
Hell, yeah I do, I got the triangle.
Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with my triangle, now that it is mmyy triangle.
Oh no you don't! Finders Keepers!
Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as you can...
It is?
Yeeh, stealth bombers.
Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass!
No, not when money is involved, stupid!
Ugh. Let me go! Seriously!
Eey! It's not my triangle, it's Kyle's!
Eechh! Screw you, hippie! Eeeh-eh.
I don't remember.
No! Don't!
AAAAAA! AAAAADUH!
WAAAGH! Damn your black heart, Barbra Streisand!
Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is, it's inside my shoe.
I suppose your socks smell like the Botanical Gardens!
Yes! She stole my triangle!
Make it go away! I hate Barbra Streisand! I hate her!
Sweet!
No way! You gave it to us-it's mine now!
Huh?
Eh. Aaah-ah! Aaah!
Thanks for your help! Visit us again!
No! That's my walkie-talkie, he gave it to me!
Come on, Stan, it's mine! I'll ro-sham-bo you for it!
Yeah, and I've learned something, too. Robert Smith kicks ass!
Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?
You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants.
Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?
Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am.
Why, thank you, Polly Prissy Pants. How nice of you. [Sips.]
Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey.
My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants.
That's niiice, Peter Panda.
More tea, Rumpertumskin?
Thank you, Rumpertumskin. And what do you think about me, Clyde Frog?
Eeeyy!
No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!
No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!
Mom? Can I ask you a question?
You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?
And my friend Kyle has - a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad?
God-dammit!! Do I have a dad?!
I want to know where I came from.
Uh huuh.
So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha?
So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?
[Weighs the story.] That isn't a very romantic story, Mom.
Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Native American.
No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!
[Indian music plays.] Native American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people.
Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut!
Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation.
My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?
Hiya, Dad!
I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Liane Cartman.
But my mom says you're the guy she was with.
Whatooya mean?
Huh??
Eeyy!!
[Alone with the Chief] His tongue? Chef?? Chef is my dad??
Oh my God! I'm a black African American!
[With rap beats playing now.] 'S up, homies?
I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.
[Aloofly.] Weh hunh hrhrh hrh huh-right! Like I'm some hippie Indian.
You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad.
Yo, Pops!
You know, jus'... layin' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I'm sayin'?
Westsa-eed-eh.
You're my dad, Chef. Chief Running Water said - you got together with my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance.
He said you kissed her with your tongue.
[Dejected.] Huho. So you're not my dad?
What?! Who the hell did that to my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance?!
No! Noooooo! No, God, Nooo!
Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.
Really? You don't think so?
[Grabs a teacup.] Gee, that's kewl.
All this time! Why didn't you tell me, father?!
It was you all along. You were with my mother the night of the Drunken Barn Dance!
Then you did sleep with my mom?
[Turns around.] How?
Really? You can? [The dirge turns hopeful.]
How much?
I don't have $3000.
[Depressed.] Hi guys.
Oh, fine. How are you guys?
Ohh. Nothing. It's just... nothing.
Well, I wanna know who my dad is, but... to find out they have to do these DNA tests, and they cost $3000 and... I don't have $3000.
Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh...
Well, see you guys. I'm gonna go stay in my backyard for a while.
[Suddenly bright.] You do?
You will? Wow, you guys are the best! Thank you guys!
What kind of video did you guys make?
Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.
I... am... so... pissed... off... right... now.
[Slowly, deliberately.] I am going to fucking kill you guys, seriously.
Kill... you... guys! Kill you guys!!
[Record scratches.] What?! [Enunciating] Son of a bitch!
He's my father?!
Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life.
Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!
[Grabbing Mephesto's shirt.] Goddammit! Who's my father?
You've got to be kidding me!
Eeeehh..!
Is he awake yet?
They can't. Mephesto can't die.
No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, "Come Sail Away", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it.
Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.
No! Don't!
Eh--
For I've got to be free,
I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
Yeah, stop being a wuss!
Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.
Wake up, you son of a bitch!
I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?
What?
--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea
...We'll search for tomorrow on every shore...
...And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on...
I look to the sea; Reflections--
...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?
Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?
Sweet.
Hey, who's screwing with the lights?
[To Kenny.] That is really starting to piss me off.
Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me.
What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?
Go, Kenny!
Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop.
Just tell us already!
[Boiling.] Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!
Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak.
Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!
No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my mom?!
Ooohhh, forget it!
[To Kyle.] Reading sucks ass.
Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books.
[Irritated.] God, shut up, dude.
I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these.
[In falsetto.] Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle?
Oooaaagh.
I'm prepared!
For my book report, I read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison?
Oh, good. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus.
God-dammit!
[Miffed.] Goody two-shoes.
Really? I wanna be a cop.
Do I get a nightstick?
10-4, sergeant! [Walks off.]
Ey!
I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?
Step out of the car, please, sir.
[Slower.] Sir, step out of the car, please.
Ey! I am a cop, and you will respect my authoritah!
Get your ass to jail!
[Getting carried away.] Sweet.
Yeah, I've been working this beat for about three days now. You definitely have to have pretty thick skin or else these people, they just walk all over you. [The camera checks out traffic.] Sometimes you have to go undercover to get the worst of them.
Well, hi there.
Uh, wha-what are you doing tonight?
Sir, step out of the car, please.
[Displays his badge.] Sir, step out of the car.
[Pulls out his baton.] Maybe this'll teach you to listen to authoritah.
[Exhales.] Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time.
Sir, could you step out of the car, please?
And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?
[To the camera.] Poor people tend to live in clusters.
Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a...
Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh.
Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah!
[Stops, gasps.] Chickenlover!
Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?!
[Rushing up.] Freeze! Put your hands in the air!
I got reports that the suspect is in this area!
A-ha!
Well, he is not listening to my authoritah!
Ooohhhh.
Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys.
M'kay?
What the hell is a "bris"?
Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!
Yeah, my ass is killing me.
I wonder who took it.
I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck.
Wo-what's that?
Ham?
Screw you! It's ham, isn't it?
Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman.
That's the proper way to say it, or else you get a spanking.
Dude! That is not cool! Choppin' off wee wees is not cool!
Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman!
What the hell is gahekgafuga?
They are gonna cut off his fireman!
No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!
What the hell is that supposed to be?
Is that why it stinks so bad?
No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house!
Eech.
Wait a minute! No, you wouldn't!
Fireman!
Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence.
[A bit solemnly.] Yes. The fireman is very magical. If you rub his helmet, he spits in your eye. [Stan draws a blank.]
Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision, too. [Kyle looks up.]
Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!
Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?
No way, I set up mine first, hippie!
Okay?
[With Clyde and Stan looking on.] What? Don't you have dodgeball in France?
Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you.
[Ominously.] Dude! He's going to the nurse's office.
Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?
Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?
Who the hell cares what it's called? As long as she doesn't have to touch me...
AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!
Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.
Heyh! They have a zoo there!
Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy.
I caught it, I caught it!
Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumb-ass European hippie piece of crap.
[Quickly.] I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll!
My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.
So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh?
I dunno.
Come on, rice picker!
[At the same time.] Oooh, I get it.
Holy crap!
I love you guys.
Ah, screw you guys!
Mr. Garrison, what's Vietnam?
Son of a bitch.
Was it fun?
Man, Vietnam was sweet!
Sweet.
You're dead, Stan.
Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week.
Well, let's see... Maybe 'cause he's an old, drunk hillbilly dick!
Totally.
[As Kyle whispers his plot.] Sweet. Oh, yeah, sweet. That's super sweet. Ah-yes!
Lying kicks ass!
Blululululululuh. I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. I am very scary... And dangerous!
[Popping up.] What?
I know that!
[Thinks.] It's a Sri Lanka frog!
Der yourself, hippie!
[Pops up.] I'm ready, Steven Spielberg! [Drops.]
[Moves the frog around.] Blulululuh. Screw you guys.
Well, why do I have to dress up like an old lady?
Ee-goddammit!
They better not!
Scared of a plastic frog?
Man, this is stupid.
Eee-ee-ee-ee!
Dude, totally.
[Relishing the moment.] Revenge is so very, very sweet.
Dibs!
That's it! Now I'm all pissed off!
Take that, hippie!
Ey, get off of him, you fuckin' nutsack!
Ey, you guys!
Yeah. I didn't wanna do it, Jesus. They made me do that.
Sent her away where?
What?
[Finishes a bite.] Hmmm, let me see. No!
Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.
[Now baiting.] Mmm. I can't possibly finish this whole cake. Oh, yes I can. [Resumes eating.]
[Exhausted.] I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try.
All done!
Ms. Crabtree?
You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here forever.
I don't wanna die on this- bus with you assholes! [Panics.] You guys suck!
Oh, man, this sucks.
[Farts fire.] Ow!
Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
I don't wanna.
Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!
It's completely immature!
You guys can't scare me!
Was that how it happened?
God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take?
What?! I'm missing the new Fantasy Island.
What do you think it is?
Heellp!
What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
Scuzzlebutt kicks ass!
Hey. Maybe it's our teacher, Mr. Garrison.
Oh no? Don't you remember the time he went crazy, and tried to kill Kathie Lee Gifford?
Beefcaake!
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation.
Oh, yeah.
Hey you guys. Can we order a pizza?
I wonder when the monster is gonna come back to feed again?
Hay, wait a minute.
Remember the time when Fonzie jumped over the buses with his motorcycle?
You can do it, Fonzie.
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Uheheheh, heh.
[Thinks.] Oh yeah, I guess that doesn't make sense.
It does?
Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new Barnaby Jones.
Hey! Do you guys remember the time I found out who my father was?
Sweeeeeett! [Smiles big.]
This kicks ass, you guys! John Elway is my father!
My father is John Elway,
Now, that's what I call a sti-
What?! Eeyy, you son of a bitch! I'll kick you in the nuts!
Wait, wait wait wait. This doesn't make sense. This whole thing doesn't make any sense. I must be-
Deah, eh eh. [Sweats.] Oh man, what a weird dream!
Ma? I just dreamt that me and Stan and Kyle and Kenny were trapped on our bus, and we were talking about everything that happened to us, except that it was all wrong and everything ended with us eating ice cream.
Yes, please.
Mmmm. [Munch munch gobble.] Mmmm.
Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip!
Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!
[Mumbles.] Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na.
Okay, that's it!
Screw you guys! I'm going home.
What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!
Stan?
Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?
Ugh... Whatever.
Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come?
It is not!
I am not swimming around in pee!
My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday.
I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home.
Uh, screw you guys. Home. [Leaves.]
Eh-eh-eh-eh...
Nuh-uh.
I don't wanna.
Egh--
Huh? First graders?
Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, y-you sons of bitches!
Later's fine.
I only know how to do it doggie style.
Can I do it doggie style?
Sweet..!
Awww, dammit! Aw, not again!
No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home.
Fine.
Well, you heard wrong, hippie!
[Distracted.] Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song!
Where is Chef?
Wow.
Okay. No first graders around. I can swim to the deep end.
Yeah... I can do it. I can do it. I can-- I'm gonna make it.
I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it to the deep end.
I did it! I did it! I made it to the deep end! Hooray for me!
Huh?
Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..!
How's it going?
No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding.
Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!
I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!
...bitch.
I'm going!
I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend!
What kind of cookies?
I wanna Fudge 'Em.
[Taunting.] Stan, nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh. Tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh?
She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him.
[To Kyle.] Jesus, he sure ran that one into the ground.
Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime.
It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?
Yeah!
Ay!
Okay, that's enough fat-ass jokes for this week.
Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home.
I'm gonna, just give me a minute.
Yeah, I love these Salty Chocolate Balls, Chef.
Aw, man, smells like ass down here.
Aw, man, let's get out of here!
What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?
This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?
Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm home.
[Displeased.] Hi, Mr. Hankey. Nice to see yuh.
No.
[Incredulous.] Oh my God.
Huh? Uhuh, yeah, I guess.
All of us?
Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them.
Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
[Mocking.] I'll momaymumyeu, Meemuhmammy.
[With director 3.] Eh but, but this doesn't make sense to me, Marty! Okay, you told me the movie made a lot of money!
I'm not a sellout! What's a sellout?
Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95!
Selling T-shirts kicks ass!
Whoa!
Yes. And I've learned something, too.
Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home.
No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto.
Oh weak!
In the ghetto
And his momma cried
What?
[Scanning the room.] Where is the Nintendo?
Oh, good. I'm starving.
Pfff..!
[Coolly.] What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?
Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?
Puh! I heard that.
Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?
[Hushed.] Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either.
[Recoiling.] Ey!
Man, your family sucks ass, Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner?
It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?
Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!
Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.
[Whining.] But mom, seriously, it itches. I can't stand it!
[Whining.] Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches!
I don't wanna.
Ugh. Uunnh.
Ey, give me that!
Ahhhh...
More calamine lotion!
Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!
[Somber.] Oh, no. [The itching returns.] Damnit!
No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!
Uh. Yes. Uh...
[Releases Mr. Kitty.] It's about friggin' time! Give me that!
Uugh! Yeessss. [His voice trails off.] Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh...
"I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool."
Mom, answer that! "They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool."
I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.
She what?!
That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!
We want you to give our parents herpes.
Hell no, you guys get your own!
Hey, how come you don't have sores on your lips, Ma?
Hooray!
Well, I know one thing for sure.
We're all gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.
Planetariums suck!
I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!
Hey, there it is!
I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behind my back!
But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!
[Whining.] But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial!
How long is that Cheesy Poofs van gonna be outside?
As if we care.
Aw man, screw this.
Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!
Eric Cartman.
[Clears his throat and affects a tenor]
Thaat's right, suck on that.
[Happily popping by.] I did it! I did it!
I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song!
Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!
Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.
[With some pity.] It's sad how jealous you are, Kyle. It really is.
Hey, be careful, asshole!
Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams.
Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?
Wweell, I might have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship!
This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it? [Now taunting.] Hey, where is your regional championship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?
Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?
Apparently, only I do.
Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion.
It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
Shut your God-damned mouth
I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!
I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.
Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!
Sike!
I know, I know!


Thank you.
I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch!
[Triumphantly.] Yes! I'm the best!
[Joyfully.] Sweeet!
I'm over here.
Aay!
Let's hurry. This costume is hot.
I love Cheesy Poofs, you-
Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake!
I love Cheesy Poofs-
Oh, man, c'mon!
I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Chee-
What?!
Oh, God damnit!
Hi, Grandma. It's me, Eric.
I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch.
Okay, bye.
Stan? I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Be sure to watch.
Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it!
Oh, dude, here it comes!
Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!
Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!
Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television!
You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium!
Planetariums suck ass!
What the hell are you talking about?
Wow. What a day this has been. I was on TV, and, I'm a hero.
God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch!
What is this? Halt!
It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!
I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--
--special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets.
That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!
What?
Herr Kommandant Cartman has ways of making you talk!
What are you guys doing?
[Laughs heartily.] A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!
[Thinks it over.] Wwwhy??
That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse!
Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!
Fine!
Fine! That's fine.
Fine!
No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman!
Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker.
No, Kenny.
Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse!
Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?
[Sliding into a whine.] But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse!
Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now.
And stop your bitchin'!
So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?
We'll see about that. [To Kenny.] Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny.
Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education.
Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built.
Oh, man!
And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.
All right. You go find chicks, Kenny.
Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!
Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?
What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon?
Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?
[Amazed.] Holy crap!
Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!
[Enunciating properly.] Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack? [Rubs his stomach.]
How's the clubhouse coming, Stan?
Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.
It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole.
Ahaw, that's weak.
That's killer.
That's totally weak!
Sweet.
Killer weak, sweet!
I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, "Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!"
Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!
[Voice shaking.] Coming, Mom. [To the girls.] Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick!
Who the hell are you?!
How many people?
Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?
This is bullcrap!
This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Wwow!
[Breathlessly.] Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?
Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!
That's easy!
Ay! Check it out!
Damn it!
Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt!
I'd like to see you do better!
I only have three dollars left, asshole!
Sweet.
I only need one, dude. I only need one.
How much is it?
Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five.
Oh come on, you guys. We'll still have plenty of money left over.
I'm right!
Eh! God-damnit!
[As they step down.] I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!
Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money.
Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!
I think we're almost to the end.
How much?
Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet.
What? This is cool.
It is, too!
Aah, three dollars.
Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math.
Ey! Seriously!
Well, I'm sorry!
[Thinks a moment.] Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him!
Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends!
Sweet.
What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
O-kay, I'll get on the bull.
I guess, damn!
Hey, this is sweet.
I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.
Ye-gah!
Ow!
Son of a bitch!
[Whispering.] You guys, eh seriously, my back!
[Whispering.] Seriously. Help.
Screw you guys. Hate you guys.
[Whispering.] I hate you guys!
[Whispering.] Hate you guys.
[Hesitantly.] Nnoo.
All right, get down. This is my kind of bull-ride.
Yeah, this is sweet!
Eeyy!
Ey! Seriously, you guys! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!
Mother f-

[Arrives, back to normal.] What are you guys doing?
Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest dream last night.
Well, I dreamt that I was a poor Vietnamese girl, and then you guys made me ride a big, scary bull, and then Leonardo DiCaprio gave me a spankin' for several hours.
Hey, where did you guys win all those Terrance and Phillip dolls?
Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull!
Oh! Son of a bitch!
[Singing.]
This new song by Alanis Morissette. I can’t get it out of my head.
Stinky britches,
Yeah, I can’t get this stupid song out of my head.
Yeah.
[Quietly to himself.]
You got stinky britches,
It’s all over the place. On the radio, MTV, everywhere.
You wrote it?
Yeah, and he’s Jewish.
What's a "Chewbacca defense"?
Goddamn, I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, "Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!"
Wow, he’s good.
Ready.
I will do the German dance for you
[Putting his coat back on.] See? I told you guys it would work.
What's that?
No, it isn't, you guys.
We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef.
Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?
We have Chocolate Nuggies and S'more Crunchies...
What?!
Three Crispy Yum Yums.
Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars for our dying friend.
[Whispers.] Shut your goddamn mouth. [To Meat Loaf.] We have Nilla Crunchies, Berry Bars--
Well, you can see here that we raised approximately $95, falling well short of our $2 million goal illustrated hyeeah.
[Voice breaking.] No more Salisbury steak and... pecan pie. [He starts sobbing.]
Four.
Yeah!
I will do the German dance for you
I hope my will enjoy my dance,
Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay
[Faster.]
Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!
Ha-ha, you're a wuss.
Hey guys. How's it going?
You guys, you're so funny. No matter how I'm feeling, I can always count on you guys to lighten me up.
I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed
I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.
[Excited.] Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too?
[clean-shaven] Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!
Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to you assholes!
Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!
'Cause I'm hella cool, that's why.
You guys are just hella jealous.
[with mustache and beard, and dressed in raingear] Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions. [a box of SUPPLIES is next to him. The parents look at each other] There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to. [walks off].
Well, where is it? [Kenny brings out a squash and sets it on the table] What the hell is that?!
It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squah-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!
[cuts the top off the squash and taps at the bottom to clear it out. Sigh] God, I hate you, Kenny. [works on the squash some more] I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull! [goes into the kitchen for another one]
[gives Kenny a hand] No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?
Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here.
Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!
What do you mean, what am I doing?! I'm just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys.
Why the hell not?!
[seeing his parallel for the first time] Aaah! Son of a bitch!
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Dude, this is hella weird.
...and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and this son of a bitch is standing there!
He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.
Ey, sweet! [hops on her lap] Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her.
Dude, this is hella cool.
Who's "we"? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!
Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!
Screw you! [the fish spits Kenny's corpse out of the tank and jumps back in. Kenny's left eye is gone and the water is clear]
Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!
Uh-ho-ho, man, that's hella funny! [slaps his thigh]
No, Kitty, this is my pot pie!
No, Kitty, this is my pot pie, Kitty!
NO KITTY, BAD KITTY!!! [Evil Cartman is startled as Kitty jumps away.] Hahaha, you-hoo suck, dude.
Aw, man, this movie is hella scary. [click. The front door flies open and Evil Stan and Evil Kyle burst in]
P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?
Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
What's wrong with me? Let's see. Uum. [checks them off] I hate you guys. You're hella stupid.
Don't touch me! [punches Evil Stan, who releases him]
Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!
Oh, it's about freakin' time you showed up! You don't want me, you want that impostor Cartman! Come on, I'll show you. [leads them out the door]
[to Evil Kyle] Now, zap his hella ass back to your- hella universe!
Ey, you backstabbin' sellout!
All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!
What?!
Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!
That's right, I did!
[to Kyle] Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a big present, for no reason, except that I'm cool.
Oh, I didn't think you were coming, Stan.
[rushing past Kyle, who joins Stan on the back seat] Shotgun! It's my car, I call it first: shotgun! [opens the door, only to find Kenny already there. They look at each other] Kenny, I called it shotgun! [Kenny stares back] Dammit, Kenny, get in the back! [Kenny moves not. Cartman points to the right] Hey, Kenny, there's a sale on orange jackets over there. [no movement. Cartman points to the road] Look, Kenny, there's an elephant parade! [Kenny is not moved. Cartman reaches into his pocket and pulls out a dollar] Ken-ny. Kenny, look. Look! Go get it! [throws the bill away], Go get it! [Kenny hops out and Cartman jumps in] ha ha ha, you poor piece of crap. [Kenny gets the bill and hops into the back seat. Lo and behold, there is an elephant parade, with clowns and jugglers and... Liane drives off]
Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?
[Kyle angrily kicks him into the dashboard] Argh!
[rubbing his nose] I guess, damn! [some traffic is seen]
We don't care, Mom.
Oh, so now everybody wants to meet Mr. Hankey! He's a piece of crap.
How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me.
Why does Grandma have to live so far away? Why don't we just stick her in a nursing home closer to us so [angrily] I don't have to drive six hours to get a god-damned present?!
Over the meadow and through the woods...
[runs to the front door] Grandmagrandmagrandmagrandma! [knocks, rubs his hands together, and an elderly man opens the door. The boys come up behind Cartman]
Hi, Grandpa!
Sweet. What is it?
Yes! Move it! [shoves Grandma off the porch. She screams on the way down]
[in sync] I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Ech.
Al-righty then. Let's get to my presents, shall we?
[not pleased] Wait a minute. This isn't a present, it's a shirt! [lifts it out]
[really upset] Are you telling me that I drove nine hours through butt-fucking nowhere to get a god-damned shirt?! Mom, Grandma's gone senile! It's time to stick her in a home!
I can't believe I got a stupid shirt! [he didn't have to wear it...] The holidays are bullcrap!
[flatly] Hi, cousin Elvin.
Yup!
Amen. [his feelings exactly]
Bad Jimmy!
Whatever it is, it's getting closer. [Stan pinches him] Ow! What the hell was that for!
Ow!
Yuhwell, you're not dreaming! [Kenny flies at him with a punch] Ey! Cut the crap!
Uncle Howard!
Uncle Howard, what are you doing here?!
Wow, cool!
Okay.
Who's we? You got a turd in your pocket? Hahahaha.
[waking] What?
[putting his coat on over his BEEFCAKE muscle shirt] All right, keeps your pants on.
[follows the boys up the stairs] Okay. [puts on his cap]
Can somebody drive us to the mall?
[insistent] Hello, Mr. Hankey is appearing at the mall. Can somebody please take us?
[pops up in front of Stinky] Uncle Stinky, can you drive us to the mall?
Uncle Stinky, my stupid friends want to see Mr. Hankey! You have to take us!
[leaves grumbling] Damn his Goddamned authorituh!
I don't wanna take care of Cousin Elvin!
All right. Give me $10. [she reaches into her purse and gives it to him]
[coming down the stairs with his friends and Elvin] My family sucks ass!
Here. We got you some sticky cinnamon buns. [hands the bag to Howard]
My stupid friends want to go to the mall to visit Mr. Hankey, but nobody would drive us.
Stan, don't be such a dumbass. You have to trust people. [walks away]
How the hell did Mr. Hankey get so popular? Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff. [a display is seen of Mr. Hankey caps, T-shirts, cups, figurines, and posters]
And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall!
So, how can Mr. Hankey be here, and in another mall at the same time?
Oh, it looks like you finished your Fudgecicle, Elvin. [Elvin looks at his hands and sees nothing to lick, then begins to cry] God damnit, be quiet, Elvin! Shut up, Elvin! [grabs a stick and whacks him on the back of the head. Elvin is now catatonic, but manages a blink] No, Elvin, bad Elvin! [seeing that Elvin is not responding, he looks around]
[the boys regroup] I told you guys. The holiday season is nothing but lies and bullcrap!
Oh, uh that's pretty cool.
[outside, falling behind with Elvin] Ugh! Wait! You guys. Seriously. [the officers follow]
Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Lock the door! [Terrance and Phillip are on]
See ya, Uncle Howard. [mad] Thanks for being such a great role model for me. [very softly] Piece of crap.
Yeah, that's fine.
How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond.
Oh, so that's where all my underpants go.
Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?
Heheh, you suck, Kenny.
[running around the rim of a throw rug like an Olympian] You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.
[rushing up] Ey, let me have some grounds. [take some, swallows, and throws up]
No...more...coffee. Blech. [the vomit falls back on him and on the ground]
[steps forward] What will become of the endeavoring American family?"
Neither did we.
[pissed] Aw, man, this sucks!
This guy sucks ass!
[screen left to screen right] I believe in the family-owned enterprise.
What now?
Why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time?
["until we have underpants"] I think my mom is a corporation.
["until we have underpants"] Well, I'll be damned.
Bad! [whacks the gnome with a stick]
What?!
Well, look at him. He's all, you know, uh l-look at him. [whacks him again]
What?! [advances]
Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not a pussy, you're a pussy!
Ey!
[muttering] Little pussy gnome. Don't call me a pussy, pussy gnome.
Oh, are you gonna take us to your little pussy house?
Oh, your pussy village?
[the boys look at him] I hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker.
[exhales] No it isn't, you guys!
So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal?
Oh, I get it.
I love you guys. [more laughter]
I told you guys.
[with Aussie accent] There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!
[advancing towards Kyle] Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey!
Come 'ere, crocky.
Well, he shouldn't have called me fat. [backs up]
Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles! [turns around and walks off]
I'm right here, Kyle.
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my face, pussy!
[moves away] Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles.
Screw you, hippie!
Come on, you guys, it's getting cold up here!
Really? [to Kenny] Hey, there's a frozen guy down there.
Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about "Greased Lightning." [no response] You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the-
Aww, screw you guys anyway!
For what?
I think we're almost there, you guys.
Yeah, like the kid with the wallet.
Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!
Sweet.
Killer.
Fine.
Damn, I'm pretty freakin' cool all of a sudden.
Well, I don't see any crocs out here.
[walks over to a cat nearby] Or, in other words, I'll let this jagu-ar bop me in the face and see if it hurts. Come on, jagu-ar, let's see what you've got! [the cat leaps up and scratches his face] Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch cat!
Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face.
He might have been, by crikey.
Wow! Kick ass!
Yeah, I think the same thing.
Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches.
I'm gonna go jam my thumb in some'in's butthole now.
They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.
[still hunting] Be very very quiet. I'm hunting crocodiles, hahahahahaha.
Oh yeah?! Well I don't need you guys anyways! You guys can kiss my- [turns left and goes Aussie] Aha! There's a king croc right there! [a cow grazing on a tiny patch of grass. Cartman sneaks up] And what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sneak up on it, and jam my thumb in its-
Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here.
Okay.
What if you don't have any rhythm?
Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.
Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. [the other kids laugh]
[drops down and pleads] Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.
[as he enters the bus] Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.
Whoopee.
Yeah, pretty much.
[hushed] The nightmare begins.
Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!
Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?! [Throws open his window and yells] Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!
[sits] Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny? [Kenny looks at him angrily] Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor.
Whoa, dude, look over there! [The bus stops. There are three women in front of a shop. A man has just dropped them off, pays them and drives away, and they wave at him.] Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!
Okay. [pretends] Kugheek! [grins]
[rushing out] Oh my God, [covers his nose] it smells like ass out here.
[covers his nose again] I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.
I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!
Why?
Eh-heheh!
I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
[impatient] Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah. [Pablo looks at him] We hear this a million times back up in the States.
[takes a branch and starts beating the monkey] Bad! Bad monkey! [it screams in pain]
[stops] I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, “Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!” and I smack him on the head!
[takes the branch and starts beating the sloth] It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!
[throws the branch at the sloth] Re’spect my authoritah!
[fed up, buries his face in his mitts] Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!
He's a little wuss, what's it look like? [Stan is hiding behind some foliage]
Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!
[beats the snake, which turns and comes at him] Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! [hurries away, and the snake gives chase]
[moves forward] Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca. [the soldier listens] We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. [rubs his belly]
Y taco.
Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.
[turns and walks back the way they came] This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.
I'm going this way!
[stops] Look: you can stay over nyah [gestures towards her], but I'm going over nyah. [Gestures away from her]
Nononono! You nyah, me nyah! [gestures forward and backward] Screw you guys, I'ma going home. [walks away]
God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat- [finds himself at a clearing full of bulldozers moving wood around] Yes! I knew it! I'm saved! [rushes in]
[reaches the foreman] Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!
I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!
Food! I have to have food! [falls on his face]
[lifts his head] Chicken wings. [drops it]
[lifts his head] Medium spicy. [drops it]
[arriving] Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?
Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?
Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-
What the hell happened to him?
I'm gonna be Jesus!
Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!
Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! [gestures his intent.]
Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. [gestures again, and again]
[retorts] Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.
This is stupid. Screw you guys, I'm going home. [walks off]
Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.
[now carrying the cross] This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak.
Peter!
Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.
Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven. [Stan replaces Cartman's cap with the crown] So I guess it's cool. [Stan returns to the pulpit]
[on his way out the door] Hi, mom. [Stan leaves the pulpit and the priest returns]
Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys.
Up your ass with broken glass!
Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?! [they stop and turn]
Well, get me down from here!
What?!
Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home! [looks around] Okay, I'm getting pissed now! [struggles to get loose, but doesn't get anywhere] God!
[wakes up] Hey, there you guys are!
You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!
You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down!
...Really?
[watches them leave] ...When I get all my superpowers, I'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet! [to himself] Dude, superpowers are sweet.
[vultures hover above him] You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here!
Officer Barbrady! [Barbrady looks up to see Cartman on the cross and says nothing for a while]
Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch! [to himself] Huh, I'm gonna die up here.
You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.
Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen. [prepares for a bit of ventriloquism] Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.
[still in falsetto] Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now.
You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!
Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my "I hate Stand and Kyle" song?! Ahem.
I hate Stan and Kyle
[whispering, hoping...] Hey you guys. Seriously. [Chef walks into view]
Chef! Chef!
Just get me down from here! [Chef does] Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!
Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys!
What?
What?!
[waking up] Oh, damnit!
Hello-o.
[in a slight falsetto] Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now.
Get me down from here!
Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.
Mom, please can we just leave?
But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.
That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason.
[enters the examination room] Weak. [the assistant follows him in to close the door.]
[resigned] Hi, Doctor Lout.
[points his finger at him] Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!
I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!
[turns around and sits] God damn it!
Yes.
I am a little piggy. Ey! [the optometrist laughs. Cartman stands up on the chair and pushes the refractor away.] That does it! Mom!
Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
They look exactly the same.
I don't know, two!
Uh, one.
[chooses the cake] Two.
Ow! I hate you!
[with very dilated pupils] Hey dudes.
My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!
Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Hey, yeah! [The four enter the kitchen, but Cartman runs into the entrance and falls on his way in.] Ow!
[rubs his eyes] Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy.
Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. [chuckles]
[runs into the door] Ow!
My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.
Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
Bitch, I hate that bitch!
[sits on the chair, his pupils normal again] Stop calling me piggy!
So, what does that mean?
[seething] All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair [throws a fit] and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!
[after seeing how they look and fit] Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me.
I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
Ow! Son of a bitch!
Hey dudes. [the others study him, then laugh. Cartman's hurt, but jabs] Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!
I can't! They're stapled to my head! [they study him again, then laugh harder.] I hate you guys.
[dismissively] Uh, yeah, sure sure.
Ey!
Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.
Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!
Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?
Oh, no!
Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow.
But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!
Hey! You son of a bitch!
Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh- [Dr. Lott turns up the sleeping gas] I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh [the gas knocks him out]
That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!
Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?
Okay. [Liane leaves, and Veronica soon enters]
Aaah! It's the succubus! [looks in her direction as the others jump, and Kenny pulls his hood tight]
What? What happened?
You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.
You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep. [rolls over]
[picks up] If we can hold on to the night.
[rattled] What what what?
I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!
Okay. [Stan and Kyle leave]
Ow! [Veronica reaches Stan and Kyle, but the backwards version of "A Morning After" soon plays]
Oh no! The tape jammed! [Veronica transforms again, this time tearing through the gown, revealing her huge wings and succubus body. The congregation reacts with groans and screams]
[pressing every button on the tape player] I can't see anything!
[presses the right button] Got it! [music resumes]
What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?
After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!
No, not with my eyes. With these! [takes Kenny's frozen head out of the box to show the eyes] Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Eh-sure.
You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, "I Hate You Guys":
Okay now, let's try one all together:
I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.
I have to go number two.
No way, dude! What would I wipe with?
Well what do I sit on?
[moves away] God, I'm glad you guys know all these "pooping outside" rules! [he squats some distance away and begins] Urgh. Come on, now.
Stop, you guys! I can't think!
I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream... [a dump is heard] Oh, that did it.
Poopin' outside,
[hears some rustling and zips up immediately] What the?
Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!
[urging] You guys, get over here!
I'm serious now! [the boys walk over to the spot] Look. Over by those bushes.
Come on! Let's kill it! [the boys move forward]
[trying to keep up] Come on, you guys!
Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny.
[intervening] No! No. Don't.
I like it.
Wow! Cool!
[wondering] Wow, a dragon right on the blade. Mom, can I get a Sumatomi sword used by the ancient Tokugawa soldiers??
Sweet. [someone knocks on the front door] Mom, somebody's at the door.
Should I get it?
Okay.
Okay, okay, hold your horses! God! [opens the door and screams. An angry jakovasaur glares at him. Cartman backs into the living room] Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature!
You mean the other jakovasaur?
You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.
But the other jakovasaur talked different.
I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it.
He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left. [the others stay silent, looking at him]
Will you stop with the whole "mom smoking crack" thing?! It's a old joke!
No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in. [the closet door opens and the jakovasaur comes out]
Jakov, I want you to meet my friends.
Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny?
We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend.
No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.
[laughing] Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov.
[reading his acceptance speech] "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."
I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."
[walks to the podium and speaks] Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction.
You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me... [finds himself all alone in the square] Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor!
If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct.
Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!
[picks up a baby and says sweetly] Aren't they cute, you guys?
["School, school! I like school!"] I like going to school now. Jakovasaurs are so cool. ["School, school! I like school!"]
[cheerfully] Hey, Jakov, how's it going?
[gasps] Moving?
You... can't leave. You're my friend.
[softly] Jakov, please don't go. [music] You make everything in South Park fun. [Jakov is touched] You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you.
Yes. These people, Jakov, these people need you. I need you. Please, Jakov. Stay?
[exulting] Hoo-ray! Jakov is staying, you guys! [everyone else is pissed at him]
Yes. Who would take care of them?
[a bit humbly] I have authoriteh?
[fitting into the role] Well, that should be fine, just fine. [the agents climb into their van]
Fine.
Hi, Jakov. [applause] What the hell is that? [laughter] Who's laughing?
Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready. [he and Jakov start walking]
What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show.
Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species. [brings it out] Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.
[after some study] That's Kenny with branches on his head. [looks again] Why did you bring me all the way out here, you guys?
Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix! [drops his notepad and rushes back to town]
[arriving and running up the stairs] Jakov!
[pounding] Open this door!
[facing the crowd angrily] I am Department of Interior guy, and I have authoritah! [the plane backs into the runway, then moves forward. Cartman rushes down the steps and runs alongside the plane] No! Jakov, don't go!
[resigned] Come... back. [the crowd begins to surround him.]
Don't, mother! Just, don't.
No. That's okay. I'll see you guys. [slowly walks away]
Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.
Told ya!
I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class? [cuts out two slabs]
You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. [Craig leafs through some wood scraps, and Tweek approaches a belt sander on the floor]
Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Five bucks.
Craig, could I talk to you real quick? [Craig flips him off, and Cartman puts his palms up to calm him] Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.
Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.
I don't know, Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.
[blocks his way] No, no! Craig, you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.
You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!
Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!
Those sons of bitches!
Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!
Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!
[aloof] Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.
[hushed] Egh. God damn it! [knocks again, and Craig answers] Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.
Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.
Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?
[being gracious] After Red Racer, of course.
[covers Craig's mouth] However long Craig wants it to last. [the kids laugh] T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge.
Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch! [jumps on him, and they start fighting. Kenny and Stan soon join in, leaving Tweek and Craig looking at them]
When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.
Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000.
You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.
Come on!
What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.
You just hit each other, smack each other around. [Tweek slaps Craig, and Craig slaps Tweek. No effect]
I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.
[faking fear] Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys! [serious] I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!
Fine! [the parties part ways]
Fine, that's fine!
I'm ready! [comes out, speaks softly] Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool. [stops to pull some salt out of a kettle and pats his hands together]
Respect my authoritah! [he and Craig engage in pushing each other]
[turns around to back Craig out of the ring] Dude. Come on, now. Come on.
I win!
Hey, maybe. [plants his feet again]
The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?
Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!
Come on, Craig!
Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass! [the fighters, now tired and panting, butt heads]
Come on, Craig!
'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad.
Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig.
Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!
When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind.
I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool.
What did you call me?
[indignant] That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment!
You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money.
Oh, you did it again! You all heard him!
Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second.
Th... That is correct, my honor.
He talked about having oral sex with my ass.
Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset. [sniffs, Gerald comforts him] I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes. [hides his face in Gerald's coat and begins sobbing]
Hooray!
Sweet..!
Let's see. I want that Clown Criminy game [on the cabinet next to the door. The collector puts it into Cartman's box], and that Power Jim doll. [goes to Stan's toy box] And, let's see... [pulls out a Mega Truck] Do you really like this remote-controlled truck?
Oh, well, I'll just take that, then. [tosses it into his box and reaches for a lizard] And what about this? Is this one of your favorites?
Oh, then you won't mind if I take it! [tosses it into his box]
Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.
What? But uh, why should I sue the school?
Interesting. [the collector picks up a can and presses a button on it] Ooo, Stan's asthma inhaler. I want that. [rushes to grab it]
[takes his jacket off and twirls it around]
All I know is, I got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes; I'm telling you guys, suing people kicks ass!
No way!
This is ridiculous!
Lumpy potatoes?! Oh, no!
Oh my God! You guys have to do something!
Noooo! [runs out]
What?!
Did you guys see a big panda bear in here, or not?
Where's that?
I thought you weren't supposed to run around with scissors.
You're-you're a worm. That's that's cool, that's cool.
[in cowboy gear, and six-shooter] I will! James West, cowboy and rap star! [whips out Clyde from behind his back] Quick, Artemus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek!
Are you okay, Salma Hayek?
Look out, Artemus Clyde Frog! It's a giant metal spider! [tosses Clyde aside, aims at a plush spider hanging on the edge of his toy box and fires] Bang! Bangbang! [strafes and performs a cartwheel] Yoyoyo, jiggity jiggy with it! Bang bang bang! [tosses a baseball at the spider and knocks it out of the box] We saved the day! The Wild Wild West, The Wild Wild Wild West. Uhyo wicky wicky scratch, Uh wicky wicky scratch... [the door opens]
[begging] But mmmooom, I'm playing Wild Wild West.
But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek.
[begins to rap]
No, Kitty! I don't have anything!
What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty!
No Kitty, that a bad God-damned kitty! [Kitty runs away]
[absently] Uh-huh.
[huffs] Right.
Aw, Ma.
[mad] Jesus Christ. [drops to the floor, and they rub noses]
[now approaches Shelly] Well, go put that pizza in the oven, bitch! I'm hungry! [she punches him into the wall, which leaves an impact site with paint fallen off] Ow!
You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV? [she punches him, sending him into the wall again]
You're not allowed to have people over!
This is bullcrap! [strains to open the freezer, but fails] I can't reach the freezer!
[huffs] God dammit! [goes for a chair and props it up in front of the refrigerator. As he hops onto the chair, Kitty walks in still pining] Shut up, Kitty! [turns and sees the note on the freezer door, then grabs it and reads it] Any problems, contact Eric's Mommy at 303... Aha! [hops off the chair, moves it back to the table, and sits on it. He grabs a telephone] I'm gonna call mom and tell her that the babysitter is having her boyfriend come over! Then we'll see who's the turd! [he picks up the receiver, only to find a familiar voice on the line]
[hangs up] Dammit! [waits for a moment, then picks up the receiver again. Kitty now pines on the stove]
Ey! I need to use the phone!
Ey! Aaah! Uh-ow! Ah! [she leaves and he picks up the receiver again]
[hangs up and puts his underwear back in place. Kitty resumes meowing] I'm gonna get her, Kitty! Mark my words!! [her meows are persistent] SHUT THE HELL UP, KITTY!! [Kitty screeches and dashes out of the kitchen]
[echoing Newt] They mostly come at night, mostly. [Shelly comes in and tosses Cartman off the sofa, then changes the channel to Friends. Cartman returns to the sofa] Ey, I was watching Aliens on TV!
Who the hell are you?
You know this guy?
Christ, he's like 50 years old!
Dude, that's not cool.
Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly. [Skyler enters and pulls Cartman's underwear over Cartman's head. Shelly grins and Skyler drops him.] Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God dammit!
Hey, what are you doing? [Skyler pulls back quick]
I'm gonna tell my mom on you.
Ey! You ate all the pizza!
That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass! [she snatches the note from him and sends him into the wall with one jab]
Give me that phone number!
[rises] I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick! [thinks for a moment] Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.
God dammit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip. [goes to the sink, opens the doors, and starts looking]
Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip. [pulls out a box of Playful Pussy Catnip and pours some onto the floor in front of Kitty]
[with Polaroid camera in hand and a fresh picture] Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now!
Aaaaa! [runs away, and she gives chase. He runs up the stairs, but she catches up and grabs him by the foot halfway up the stairs. He kicks her off, then hurries to his room, closing the door on her as she reaches him] Yes!
I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home!
You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh!
[sees his toy frog on the bed and walks over] What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog? [dons his cowboy hat]
Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog. [doffs his hat and sees Kitty on his dresser rubbing her ass on the wall. He walks over] Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar. [the banging subsides] You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me. [walks to the window and sets Kitty on the sill] Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope! [Kitty jumps from the window to the garage roof, then from the roof to the trashcan, then to the ground] That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty! [Kitty ends up at the front door]
Oh! God dammit!
Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!
[wary] You just want me to open the door!
What?? Ih- is she okay?
Huh?! [quickly opens the door]
Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture!
Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!
O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, dammit! [he turns away defeated, and she gives him another wedgie over the head] AAAAH! [she pulls him downstairs by his underpants and enters the living room. Cartman groans at every step he hits]
Aw, man, you guys suck.
You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!
[rocks back and forth on his hook, hands to ears] Oh my God, somebody shoot me in the head!
Don't call me fat! Now, you guys are not supposed to be in heuh! [Shelly walks to the coatrack] You get out now and respect my authoritah! [she pulls Cartman down a bit so the coatrack can act like a slingshot. She lets go and Cartman hits the ceiling] Ow! [lands on his feet as Shelly turns to walk away. She stops to watch the band and he picks her pocket to get his mom's note.]
Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over!
Well, there's a whole crappy band here! ["TURDS! Llama judgin' finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!"] Can you hear them? Here. Can you hear them? [directs the receiver towards the music]
["TURDS! Llama judgin' finger-lovin'..."] Dammit! Her boyfriend's here! Don't you believe me?!
I'll never be able to prove that son of a bitch was here! [looks at his Mr. Microphone-type radio] My Speak and Record bear. Of course.
[softly] Testing, testing, 1 2. [stops and rewinds, then plays the tape. The recording worked] Sweet. [Shelly enters and Cartman hides his radio]
Okay. See you in a while.
Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly.
Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.
No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family. [Shelly's face softens] I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day.
Yuh, you mean it?
Hooray! [Shelly exits, Cartman speaks softly] Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.
[recording] Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now.
That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve.
I'm just thinking out loud. [walks over to the bench and sits with his back to Skyler] Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?
I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler? [Skyler simply bumps him off the bench] Agh!
Gotcha! [Skyler drives away in the red van]
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?
You're not ugly.
Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?
Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know.
If you want, I could help you.
Just let me get my cowboy hat.
[dressed as James West, reaches the open door] Okay, it's clear. [Stands watch as Shelly makes her way inside]
We don't have much time!
Hurry up in there!
That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!
Oh my God! [the orgy is well under way]
You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!
[gets the catnip and holds it up high] Come on, kitties. Outside. Come on. [points the way out, then goes towards the door. The cats follow] That's it. Come on, come on. [opens the door, only to find Skyler waiting for him] Uh oh.
Yeah. I think we get along okay.
Heh. [all are afraid. Two cats hide behind Kitty] Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat!
Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush.
That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West. [raps once more]
[Shelly watches him perform and grins, then joins him in the dance]
Hey you guys! [they stop] You know what time of year it is?
That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—
—Christmastime is presents for me.
Eeyyy [Kyle stops, the others walk away], Spooky Laboratory, you guys. ["THIS WAY TO SPOOKY LABORATORY" The entrance doors are stained with blood]
Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory! [throws open the doors and enters] Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...
Cool!
[rolls his fingers around the eggs] Ewww-hoohooo.
[rolls his fingers through the lime Jell-o cubes] Oh-HO, grohoss.
Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!
[arrives] You guys, my hand totally smells like spaghetti now. Smell it. [starts sniffing it]
We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.
Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay [sits on the sofa], let's see. [softly] I waant... thiis... aand... this... [a truck] and... [flips the page] let's see, comes with so... [the Phillip doll. The doorbell rings] ...comes with two bars [circles the boxed doll], so there we go, have that... [a door opens in the background] and, let's see...
[excited, motions with the catalog] Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas?
That's only 72 shopping days left for you!
Ey! Don't call me fat! [Liane starts to giggle. Cartman is hurt] Mom, don't laugh.
[to his friends] I can't go with you guys right now.
Mom, seriously! [her giggles die down]
God-damnit, mom!
[closes the door] God, I hate you guys!
How?
[quietly] Spooky spider?
You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?
So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?
U-hi think that's a sweet idea!
This is gonna be fun!
Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' too
[taunting] "Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!" [Kyle smacks him with the shovel] Ow.
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "You-hoo"...
[providing the voice] Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?
Heh heh, I'm sweet.
Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city...
We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: "Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!"
It wasn't me! [camera pans to the corpse]
Oh, come on, Kenny! You never have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest!
A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!
I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present! [stops] ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner. [lifts up a corner of the wrapping] Let's see here. [yanks the wrapping off and away] That's good, I'll rewrap it later! [the box reads, "LIFESIZED Blow-Up ANTONIO BANDERAS LOVE DOLL. WITH REALISTIC GENITALIA"] Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up Antonio Banderas love doll! With realistic geni-ta-lia. [takes the doll out] Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool Christmas present my mom got! [blows it up through the penis]
[walks up with the doll and jingles] Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.
Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like "Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!" [heavy machinery is heard, and the boys look up to see an ED-209 unit walking towards them. It stops, turns, and settles into place]
U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!
[pulls out the sled, but the body is gone] Uuh, problem, guys.
Nno Grandma.
Nno Grandma.
Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff.
How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?
[holds the doll tight] Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!
Wow, cool!
That didn't help at all.
Antonio, no! [sees Nibblet and goes after it] You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here! [KoRn continues playing. At another part of the docks, Mr. Garrison holds court over the Halloween Costume Contest. Kenny is present]
No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!
No, Kitty! [the TV screen shows a blond Ash-like figure surrounded by three little monsters]
[affecting an anime look] No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?
[exults] Hooray! [hops off the sofa and begins to walk away...]
Yes.
Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!
[turns off TV and rushes to the kitchen, tossing the chicken tenders away] Mom! Mom!
[pants] Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store!
Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!
[breathless] Muh-Mom, I've only just heard. They're making Chinpokomon dolls, mom. You can collect them all. You can collect them all, Mother; quick, come on. Let's go to the toy store.
[stops] ...But Mo-o-om, I have to get Chinpokomon dolls before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be coo-oo-ool.
[shriek] ...But Mo-o-om, I have to get the first one, or else people won't think I'm coo-oo-ool!
Sweet.
Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon. [Liane opens the door, and both are shocked to find the store full of kids looking around and walking with Chinpokomon dolls. The class is there...]
Oh, god damnit! [walks in and runs into Stan]
Hey, dick-whore. I guess you saw the commercial, too.
Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the coolest. [walks to the Pengin canister and finds it empty] God damnit, there's no more Pengins! [Kenny walks over with one] Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it. [starts pulling]
C'mon.
C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha--
C'mon.
C'mon. Give me Pengin!
C'mon!
Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin.
God damnit, you're supposed to trade those, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!
[haltingly] You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon.
Oh, please. Cyborg Bill is so yesterday.
Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle.
It's all Chinpokomon now.
You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?
[exasperated] Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!
Duhhh!
Duhhh!
Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.
[haltingly] Oh, you didn't get a special Chinpokomon game controller. T-heh heh heh heh. Jehesus C-hrist! [Cartman presses "START" on game controller]
Cool! This game rules!
I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...
Come on, brothers and sisters
I haven't made any money yet.
Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!
Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!
[sighs] The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.
Oh, my God, that's so yesterday!
Like, eight days ago.
Get outta the way! Move it!
Ohhh.
Is this cool or not? I can't tell.
Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana. ["Ooo, Mr. Garrison is such an asshole!"]
Minata! Kite kite, churi... [farts. The class laughs]
...Gay.
Gay.
Uh... no, that's okay, Mom.
Where are you going, Stan?
Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes. [follows]
Yeah, dude, that's way over. [a rat is on Kenny, trying to nibble]
[sees rats on Kenny and swats them off] Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!
Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!
Me, too. [Kenny starts to tremble] I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause-- [Kenny falls and trembles harder. The others watch]
Ooooh-ho-ho-ho, gro-hoss! [Stan and Kyle laugh as Cartman looks on, the credits play the instrumental theme that played in the Wild Wacky Action Bike & Alabama Man commercials]
[suddenly excited] A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!
[drops and sighs heavily] Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do.
[after a while] What the hell is "Hooked On Monkey Fonics?"
[finally responds, keeping the beat] C, H. "Ch." Chalk.
T, H. "Th." There.
You're going down, bitch!
Yeah, well this year I have a secret weapon! [signals something with a thumbs-up. The monkey and drums are next to him, on the floor.]
Home-schooled kids? Who the hell are they?
What?! What the fuck that that mean?
[as the bell rings] Holy crap! [the crowd is stunned]
Come on, Fonics Monkey, drum! [it looks around] Come on! [it begins to drum something else, getting excited. Cartman looks resigned]
Uuh. Definition?
Country of origin?
Could you please use it in a sentence?
Uh- chair. C H A R E [the buzzer sounds and Eric panics] God damnit, how come I get the hard ones?! [races off the stage] Get over here, you son of a bitch Fonics Monkey!
Yeah. Too bad they have the personalities of a wet dishcloth. [the finalists come off the stage and stand in front of it.]
[mocking] Oh, yes. We must do it again.
How come you don't go to school?
You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?
[waxes poetic]
You shut up, [backhand slap] butthole.
You shut up, [backhand slap] ass-logger!
Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?
Ey! How come you never pick me?!
Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!
That does it! [gets off his seat and moves towards the door] I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!
I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled! [leaves and closes the door]
[sighing drowsily] Eeehhh.
Eehh, shut up. [stretches] Ooohhh, yeasss.
Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door.
Mom?
Could you turn up the heat just a little?
Egghhh. Dude, home-schooling rules. [turns to his right side] Yeeehhhhhhss! [goes to sleep.]
Ahhhhhhhhh. ["Jesus and Pals" is heard in the background] Ahhhhhhhhh-ahhhh. Tired, tired.
Wwaargh. Not right now, Mom. [sighs]
I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey. [she looks over and sees the Fonics Monkey tossing a box of Snacky S'mores around. She withdraws and Cartman yawns again. Stan and Kenny enter]
[sleepily] Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys.
Huh, I can't. I'm too tired. [moves to sleep again] Maybe tomorrow.
[sleepily] That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.
No, Fonics Monkey! [the monkey throws Kenny up against the ceiling and stomps on him] No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey! [the monkey smashes Kenny against the foot of Cartman's bed several times, then stomps on him until he no longer responds]
You're damn straight, he did.
Now you're gettin' it.
Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!
Oh, dude, this is not cool!
No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard.
Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!
[pointing] Start with Kenny! Start with Kenny! [Kenny looks at him]
Whoa, cool.
Totally!
Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin.
Oh. We don't know him.
Kyle's makin' mudpies; you guys want one? [the agents walk away and talk with each other. The boys laugh for a long time...]
[gasping] K-kill me.
No wait. I'll tell you. [the agents take off their ear muffs] He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him.
Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers.
Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off.
Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this? [a shot of Pat Robertson asking for pledges on the CBC channel.]
Oh, my God, this guy again. ["What we do is- "]
Oh! Aww! [Part of the second story of the house falls away.] Oh, weak! [Marvin hops down from the ship]
Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house!
Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off? ["And it's a wonderful day 'cause something-"]
No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries.
Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this? [presses a big red button on the left side of the display panel. The ship bucks and heads into space.]
Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!
Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true! [the Marklar leader looks a bit confused. Marvin steps forward and smiles. The land around the group is green and lush, water is plentiful...]
No, never. It's perfect.
Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!
Forget him! He's done for! [Stan climbs up and looks back]
No, no, he's done for. Come on! [the windshield rolls down and the ship takes off. It zooms into the distance, then straight up into space. The helicopters could not catch up]
U-u-huh. I don't remember.
Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one. [presses the big red button]
Holy shit!
It's Sally Struthers!
Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!
Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now. [Sally looks moved]
Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you. [Sally considers Cartman's statements for a moment, then...]
She bought it.
Wait. I remember. It was the red button! [presses it, and the ship zooms away. The wormhole appears again and the ship head for it]
Alright,
Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh.
What? We're not gonna come visit him.
T'heh, whatever. [the Ethiopians chatter over their new home and head for the lake at the foot of the waterfall]
Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?! [answers himself] Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!
I'm playing the drum.
You can't just "hit" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it! [to the drum, hitting it once in a while] Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fuckin' drum!! [to Kyle] That's how you rock, dude.
I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!
Ey, I'll get it!
Yes I will!
Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, dammit!
What?
No way! Flutes are totally gay!
Oh! Well, you know what I say?! [drops his drum and jumps on it] Screw you guys, I'm going home! [walks away, leaving the drum split in two]
Later.
[arrives dressed in the Grey] Good morning, gentlemen.
Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.
Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.
Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.
Yes we are!
Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.
Right.
Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield. [walks away]
Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!
[skating by on the bell] Hooray for the South!
But why? Why should they get the bell?
But we don't have to lose.
[assuming command] Gentlemen, we can win this battle! [paces] Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, "We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, "Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!" [some of the men drink schnapps]
God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
[walks up to Stan and Kyle] So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?
[sighs] I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. [the men are getting more drunk]
[walks up to Jimbo] Perhaps we should take Topeka.
They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.
No. I say we take Topeka.
[throwing his voice] I'll bet you can't.
[fake voice] I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!
[trailing, stops by his friends] Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month.
Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.
[walks by] Excuse meh.
Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee
Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle [her brows rise in surprise] on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee.
[with pipe in mouth] Where did the Confederates go, son?
Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.
[turns around] Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.
[at his tent entrance] Where are you going?
We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! [Randy stops by]
[watching the sober Confederates walk away] No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!
God, I hate you guys!
This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! [Stan and Kyle just look at each other]
Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.
[intervenes] Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take.
Yes! Yes!
Take the fort!
Suck my ass!
We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
I knew they would!
Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.
I don't. I made it up. [Kyle and Stan approach Clinton as Lincoln and Davis, respectively]
What the hell are you guys doing?!
What?!
No! We still have to fight!
NOOO!!
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- [the camera zooms out for a view of the city, then the planet, then the Milky Way, then the binary-star system of Marklar, the Marklar themselves, then another planet, then the Visitors are seen...] -AAAH!
Dammit! Dammit, I was so close! Dammit!
Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
Hahahaha haa ha!
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
Sure.
[moves to block Kyle from view. Kyle moves to the other side of the screen to be seen. They go back and forth like this for a while]
Jews...
...play stupid games.
Jews...
that's why they're lame.
It's sooo amazing! [shows the dreidel to Stan] You spin this thing on the ground and it goes 'round and 'round. I could watch it aaall day!
Jews..
...play stupid games.
Jews...
that's why they're lame.
Jews...
...play stupid games.
Jews...
that's why they're lame.
Yes, we know, Ms. Broflovski. It's so very interesting.
Jews...
...play stupid games.
[hushed]] that's why they're lame. [Gerald enters]
Jews...
...play stupid games.
Jews…
that's why they're lame.
Jews...
...play stupid games.
Jews...
Jews...
...play stupid games.
Jews...
that's why they're lame.
Jews...
...play stupid games.
Jews...
that's why they're lame.
And...
[takes Mr. Hankey from Kyle] Time to go, Mr. Hankey.
[runs up] You guys! You guys! [pants] Guess what?
I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys! [grins]
Yes! I really did.
Well, because yesterday I got my period. [lets the words hang there for a moment]
My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month.
Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture. [begins to dance away backwards] I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't. [skips out of view]
Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people. [drops the Breeze and picks up the Plug-Ups. Softly] Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm. [swaps the Plug-Ups for the Cotton Cork] Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh. [swaps the Cotton Cork for the Beaver Dam] Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!
[pleased] You did?
Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve. [Stan shrugs, but looks worried] But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear.
Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?
Tampon? What's a tampon?
Ew, doesn't that hurt?
Wow, cool!
All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this "Women Who Run With The Wolves" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.
Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve! [Stan is left alone, but Cartman returns] Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others. [walks away]
[wearing a bandana and flowers] Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind?
Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!
And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.
Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.
What's the matter, Kyle?
...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.
Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us. [tips the bowl towards Kyle, who reaches in and takes a slip of paper]
Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.
Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.
Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.
Now, the word is "spirituality." I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-
Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-
Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!
[walks in with Kyle] Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. [Jesus takes the stage and speaks]
Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.
Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. [he and Kyle walk off]
That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long.
Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh. [Kenny laughs so hard he falls off his seat]
That was pretty cool.
[with recorder] Okay, how about this one, Kenny? [plays an A note]
No? How about this? [plays a G note]
Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this? [plays a Gb note. Kyle and Stan turn around on their seat]
We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.
That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
How about this one, Kenny? [plays an F note]
That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
[aside, to Stan, softly] Stan, what's a queef?
Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!
Aaaa-
[reading another book, jumps for joy] Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!
I told you guys! Here it is, right here. "The brown noise."
"An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen." See? That means crap your pants. "The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb." What does that mean?
How about geebo, or, or mung?
Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.
[rushing into the room with Kenny wearing earmuffs] You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!
The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look. [places some earmuffs on Stan's head] There, okay. Let's see here. [places some earmuffs on Kyle and rushes back to his side of the room] Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?
[removes his earmuffs] Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch. [leads them outside where a UPS delivery man is offloading packages, and the three put on their earmuffs. He whispers] Okay. [plays that bass note again]
I told you guys!
That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
Ooooh.
They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously.
Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this. [shows it to them on his book]
Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys.
Uh-oh. [Kenny finally shows up]
Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?
Mom! MOOOM! Mom! [races down the stairs in pajamas, cap, and coat in the right hand and two dollars in the left one, and stops at Liane's feet] Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!
Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars! [shows them off] She's only given me a lousy quarter before!
[hops onto the sofa] Yeah! This is so tits!
Oh, I mean, this is so cool!
Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! [dons his coat]
Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later! [turns and walks out] Aw, man, this is so tits!
[off camera, heard running up] Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this! [Stan and Kyle look at each other, then at Cartman] Oh my God, you guys, seriously! [runs around them] Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich! [turns to face them] Aren't you stoked?!
[pants, then] Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! [presents the two dollars]
For one tooth.
Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.
Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a [stretches the words] Sega Dreamcast.
All we need is teeth.
[moves to Kenny's side] Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a [stretches the words] Sega Dreamcast?
[ignoring the answer] Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!
I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us. [tugs on Kenny's hood] "Oh, thank you, guys." You're welcome, Kenny.
How are we gonna get it from him?
Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.
Higher, you guys.
[bumps into the window] Agh! Careful, you assholes! [opens the window] To the left, you guys, left. [is moved to his left] No, camera left, camera left! [is moved in the other direction, towards Butters' head] That's it, now down. [is lowered, then reaches for the pillow]
[in falsetto] I am the tooth fairy, my child.
Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. [reaches under and grabs Butters' tooth, then beholds the treasure. He then places some money under the pillow as Butters sneaks a peek.]
Ey!
Do not open your eyes until morning. [Butters has then shut real tight; Cartman tugs in the rope and is pulled out of the room] Or else I will kick you in the nuts. [drops down] Square in the nuts.
Bull's eye!
I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.
Okay.
Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.
I know, huh?
You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys! [runs around them counterclockwise] Holy crap, you guys! I mean-
Four dollars. [the other three answer at the same time]
Do you what this means?
Tih- [the tooth he placed under his pillow is still there] Tooth? [picks it up and looks at it in disbelief] What the hell? Mom!
You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!
[laughs] You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. "There's no tooth fairy." I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh... [mother and son sit silently for a while] M- Mom?
Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?
How can I trust you? [hops off the bed] How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself. [tugs at his pajama shirt] Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.
[covers his ears] No, Mother! No more lies! [runs out of his room and shuts the door]
[flatly] There is no money.
I know!
[stops, then faces them sadly] You guys... [turns away] Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.
[faces them again] You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. [turns away again]
My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.
But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny. [Kenny approaches him and reaches out, but Cartman bushes him off] Don't touch me, Kenny. [Kenny steps back]
Kyle, open your eyes, man!
Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.
No, man, that's just a TV show.
What? That your parents lied to you, too?
How?
Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!
Yeah. [leaves with Stan and Kenny]
Wow, look at the size of these houses!
Hey, [points across the street] that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there. [the boys head for a rambling ranch house. They skip the front door and head for the back]
Got it. [Stan and the others lift Cartman up.]
What the-? [the camera peels back to show another group of kids on the other side of the bush]
Yeah! You ripped off our idea!
It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!
We were there first!
Man, that is tits!
Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...
Two percent, have my penis cut off. [Kyle gets mad at him] Two percent-
Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang. [tosses Chef a wad of bills]
That's right. Keep the change, my man.
Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?
Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!
Sure, Kyle.
So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.
[takes a scope out and analyzes a tooth] How much?
Can I ask you a question, Weasel?
[rests his scope] Do you think I'm an idiot?
These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?! [Weasel starts acting like a monkey. Kyle is seen reading another book] Get out of my sight! [Weasel hops off the chair and splits] Lousy little scum! [the phone rings] What?!
I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you! [hangs up]
Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together! [leaves the tub] This is gonna be tits!
[returns] Will somebody take those books away from him?
Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.
[thinking aloud] Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!
[retrieves the cash] I got it!
Kyle?
Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.
...Tits.
Ey! Don't call me fat, Token!
Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!
We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding!
Token, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time [walks to a rock and picks it up] I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock! [Kyle draws near to Token]
There! [chucks the rock and it knocks Token down]
[sees what he's done] Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.
[dragging the words] I'm sorry, Mom.
[dragging the words] I'm sorry, Token.
Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking? [drops from his chair] The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day. [turns and heads for the door] See ya later.
No way!
...What the hell is a hate crime?
What? A federal offense?
Oh no??
Uh, yes?
He's a black kid that goes to my school?
He is black.
I did?
No! I hate hippies!
I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about "protectin' the earth" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!
[off camera] Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!
No!
[jumping excitedly] Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!
They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!
[slaps Kenny] Calm down, Kenny!
Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
Well, come on! I don't have much time! [heads for the garage. Outside, the garage door opens and a tiny truck creaks out with Kenny at the wheel and Cartman in the back seat]
Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!
Huh-who's Romper Stomper?
Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.
Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?
[softly] Oh, thank you, Jesus. [normally] So we're friends now?
Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.
Hey you guys.
Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?
A what?
Wwhat's that?
I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here
[a guard walks past him] Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?
Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!
Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race, [hushed] then I need those cigarettes.
Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass. [Stan and Kyle look at him and bust out laughing] Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!
Well, okay... here... l'see...
Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now. [leaves the visiting area]
[at the door] Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah. [the guard opens the door and Cartman walks in]
Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.
Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes. [groans some more until a plop is heard] One. [groans and screams until a second plop is heard] Heh, two. [more groans] Come on! Uugh, come on, now! Come on, uuhhhgghh [plop] yeahhh. Hoh. Phew. [flushes the toilet and Romper looks up horrified] Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit! [walks back to Romper crestfallen]
Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here.
Son of a bitch!
[moans and tries until a small splash is heard] Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh. [walks in with a box and tosses it on the ground] Here you go, God-damnit!
Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!
But you said-
I thought that-
I want my Mo-omm [cries some more and rubs his eyes]
Mommy, I want my Mommy! [continues crying]
You will?
[turns around] What's the matter?
Uhokay. [turns and runs]
Oh. Really?
Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
Okay. [retrieves them]
Oh. I can't take these. [offers them back]
Romper?
You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.
You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!
[takes it] O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. [walks away]
[Butters looks up] You guys! [runs over a hill into view and races towards the group]
That's right! I'm back! [Clyde walks over and hugs him, and he is surprised]
What the hell's wrong with Clyde?
I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.
When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-
Hey. [pulls out the pails and tosses them at the girls' sled]
Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again.
Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
Sweet.
Hey, Romper Stomper.
Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.
You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
[begins grunting. A few moments later, and a grin breaks out on Stomper's face. A big splash follows] Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.
Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh. [splash. Romper is stunned] Ogh! Wait-
[grunts some more] Uh, what else? [splash] Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! [grunts some more, then, splash]
[praying softly at his desk] Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me.
Phew!
[praying] Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-
Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!
Yeah, me too.
[sleepily] Hoo-ray.
That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.
That was awesuhome!
[arrives with Kenny and speaks mellowly] Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin?
No, dude, you gotta try it. [hands a bottle to Kyle] It makes you feel good.
It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it. [shakes two pills out of his bottle and swallows them]
Did you guys see that?
[Clyde is a bit shocked] What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison?
There you go. [smiles, then frowns]
Whah!
I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.
So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us. [a Christina Aguilera bug is crawling all over Kenny] Hooray. [looks] Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny. [takes his pan and swings it at Kenny. It strikes, and Kenny's face is smashed in. Kenny falls forward, hits the floor, and a puddle of blood forms under him]
Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again! [runs around] She's on my back! Hah! [leaves]
You'll be inside of me...
Huh? Oh no! Agh! [tries to shake it off as it nibbles on his shoulder] Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me.
Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! Please! Hegh, hegh[the monster still munches on him as he rolls on the ground]
He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it! [Liane smacks him on the back of the head] Ow. [the clown tries once more with Stan. Stan rolls his eyes, takes the umbrella, and is showered by it when the clown presses the horn. The crowd roars with laughter as the clown revels in his cleverness]
[comments] Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts frm bursting out of my sides! [the clown gets mad as Cartman talks, then takes the umbrella from Stan and walks away in a huff]
[echoes the announcer] Sarque du Son Bleu. [sticks his tongue out. A performer comes out and starts singing] Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain.
Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers? [the quints pile on to make an X, then roll off and reposition themselves into a circle]
Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!
Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on! [they pass "LE SOUVENIRS," a booth manned by a clown dressed in yellow.]
Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash.
Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!
What's going on?
No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!
But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!
[in a low voice] You guys, come here. [steps forward. The others join him] This is totally awesome.
Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!
Hooray!
Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
Damn, we might be screwed.
[in a log ride with the other seven, passes a lumberjack scene] You see, in America we have... log rides! [Kenny and his mom are at a bus terminal in Denver. A couple passes by and drops some money into the hat. Next, Cartman and friends are at Burger Cook, a fast-food restaurant] Bacon double-cheeseburgers! [Kenny and his mom are now at Coyote Bus Lines (play on Greyhound Bus Lines) in St. Louis at night. A man peeks through a door, another man drops some money into the hat. Next day] Sheep-shearing contests!
[showing the others around a three-story shopping mall] And shopping malls! Hooray! [the girls are grinning. Kenny finally lands in Europe and goes out through gate 96]
[arrives with Kyle] Dude, what the hell happened?
Huh?
Take that! [kicks an officer on the shin]
Yeah, you suck, dude!
Yeah! God, you guys are dicks!
Yeah!
Yeah, screw them!
Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card! [tosses it in front of him] You can deny it, or cover it up.
[Front of board game box is seen with 'Kurtis' spelled incorrectly with a 'C'] It's "Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up.
Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says. [presses an electronic Bill Kurtis head]
Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS! [tosses the card in front of him]
I just gave you AIDS.
Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns [Kyle turns angry] and 800 points. [camera pans back, and Kenny's parents appear at the door with arms around each other]
God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars.
...You see. [stands] Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!
I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here [hovers his right hand at eye level], and all my friends are down here [hovers it at stomach level].
Nononono! Me h'myah [hand at eye level], you guys myah! [hand at chest level] — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah. [hand at foot level. Then he straightens up] SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. [turns around, walks out, and towards the front door.]
I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog. [looks at Clyde Frog for a few seconds, then] Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog! [walks over to the chair and hops on] I can meet new friends on the Internet! [clicks the mouse and presses a few keys, then the computer chimes. A list of chat rooms comes up] Here's a chat room: "Men Who Like Young Boys" [moves the cursor to the title and clicks on it] That's perfect. [starts typing] Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li- [replies start cascading over his message] Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316. [click on Tony's reply and starts typing] Hi Tony. [clicks and reads the reply] "So what are you into?" [replies] Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face. [clicks and reads the reply] "Kewl. Wanna get together? [softer] Smiley-face?" [replies] Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face. [clicks and reads the reply] "Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning." [replies] Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face. [clicks, then brightly] You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!
Hi, are you Tony? [the man looks unusually friendly]
Yeah! [gets into the booth and sits next to Tony]
[takes the bag] Wow, cool!
Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends [Tony places his hand on Cartman's back and starts rubbing with an open smile]; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now.
Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks. [two agents burst through the main door and head for Tony and Cartman]
Huh?
[concerned] What the hell just happened?
Okay, we'll try this again. [starts typing as BigBoned] Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to- [More quickly than before, his screen fills with cascading replies. He picks one] Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy. [starts typing] Hello, HungDaddy. [reads the reply] "Hi. I'm eight and a half inches." Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf. [Says out loud:] Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets. [Types and says:] Midgets piss me off. Frowny face. [clicks and moves on] Lemme see, how about this one?
[draws close to the man] Mister Hammerhead?
Mr. Garrison??
You wanna be my friend?
That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?
Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!
[walks up] Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!
No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being "mys-teriously" arrested, huh?! [Stan and Kyle are confused and look at each other]
I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!
Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!
YES I AM!! [Stan and Kyle back up a bit. Cartman turns and walks away]
Dr. Mephesto, I need help.
[follows Mephesto and Kevin in] You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.
Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
NAMBLA?
Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! [turns and walks out]
Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
Sure.
[looks around] ...Sweet.
[rushes up from the other direction] Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!
Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! [turns and walks away]
Thanks, dude. [poses in his beefcake swim pants for several shots before a curtain that says "I LOVE NAMBLA"]
Really? Awesome![continues to pose in various ways as camera shutter sounds are heard]
Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature, [looks back at the camera and mumbles] excluding Stan and Kyle, of course.
KIIICK ASS!
Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.
We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!
Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go.
You can't go.
No, you CAN'T go. [turns around and walks away] Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out
[sees them] What the hell? [hops off his chair and walks towards them] Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!
Hunh. [rolls his eyes] Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.
[graciously, amid some applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [takes a bow] Thank you.
They're all over the place.
Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.
Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team. [the other boys are shocked at the thought] And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. [presents him]
Now, are you a team player or not?!
Well, Butters, there is no I in "team."
Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.
Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.
Well, what?
Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.
No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long. [the paramedics finish putting Stuart into the ambulance and head for the cab]
[in a low voice] Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.
[raises his hand] Here. [he, Stan, and Kenny laugh heartily. A few seconds later his nose bleeds a white liquid all over his desk] Oh, hoho. Ow.
Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!
Huh?
Not with me, man.
[drawn out] He's fakin'! [the other kids get busy decorating the card]
But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.
"Coming in for attack, Captain." Pipew, pipipew [grabs for the yellow ship] Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.
Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser [pulls the cruiser his way] so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5.
No, mine. M'yah! [the ship breaks in two, with Kenny getting the short end] Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha [his nose spurts out white fluid again] bluh oh, ha-ow! [blocks his nostrils]
Yeah.
Okay, mom.
What's goin' on, guys?
Oh-kay.
Uh huh.
Oh, I think I see where this is going. [Kyle moans]
Stan, why don't you just ask the question?
[sings and dances]
'No no, no no, nono no!
Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.
I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?
Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.
What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah. [they return to the floor to continue play] "Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire." Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!
No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!
[smacks her] Shut up, Fluffy! [she quiets down and Cartman goes back to sleep, closing his door.]
Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! [Stan rises from the other side of the bed with the medical book, and Butters rises, too]
[rises quickly] whatwhatwhatwhat? [sees Stan and Butters] Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!
[faces them] Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!
I do! I do care! Look how much. [a blank expression is on his face] Look. Look how much I care. [the expressionless face persists]
Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA! [jumps back. His Kidney Blocker 2000 lies at the foot of his bed over streaks of blood] That son of a bitch!
[fuming] Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!
It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!
Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before.
You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in! [sits] Please.
No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!
Thank you. [signs the release form]
[wakes up] Heh. Hey, what what's going on?
Huh?
Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!
[livid] I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!
Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.
Thaaat's ri-ight.
Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
Yes I do!
Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! [rises from his seat, heads for the door, and exits]
[enters] It's okay, I'm here.
[begins pacing] Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility.
That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility! [starts barking orders] Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.
The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.
[takes out some Cheesy Poofs] Mmmm.
You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?
Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?
Whoa! Calm down, ho. [eats some poofs]
I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone![as Bog Monster] O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!
[as Captain Candycone] Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts![as Bog Monster] Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts![as Captain Candycone] I'll kick you in the nuts!
You won't let me help.
[thinks a moment…] …Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I'll do it. [Wendy remains mad at him. He does Bog Monster] Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih. [she averts her gaze, then breaks into a smile] Wendih. Seriouslih. [she chuckles] The Bog Monster speaketh.
[aloof] Uh huh.
Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.
Yeah.
Cool.
Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make "quadruple stuffs."
No way!
Me neither. [Romantic music starts to play]
Huh.
Whoa.
[withdraws his hand] Ur, s-sorry. [shoves the plate to her a bit] Go ahead.
Ahh! [they run into each other's arms and tumble down, laughing all the while. At the bottom, Wendy's on her back and Cartman is on top of her]
Okay, It will be like this forever.
Me, too!
[fronting] Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh.
Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho, [finger points at her] huhuh, he, haha.
[steps forward for a solo bridge as the others sway back and forth]
[continues] My... girrrrrrrl... [lifts up his shirt to show off the right breast—um, pec. The others turn to their right while maintaining their gaze and pointing their gun fingers at the audience. The music builds as women scream at the sight]
Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm-- [wakes up, then looks angry] Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-dammit! [suddenly thinks] Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million, don't you? That's it! [rushes out of bed]
[pacing back and forth] Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives. [stops and faces them] God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million.
Boy band.
Boy band.
There's nothing faggy about $10 million, asshole! This was a message from God!
That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass! [pulls out a tape from his back pocket] I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!
Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall. [intense] So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--
So?
What?
[throws down the tape] Dammit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!
[through the mic] Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know.
[through the mic] We'll let you know, Butters.
Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!
Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better</> do it better than that. [into the mic] Next!
Kyle's brother?
Christ's sake..!
[through the mic] Next!
[through the mic] Next audition!
[through the mic] Goddammit, NEXT!
[through the mic] Not the next song, the next PERSON! [Ike goes for his sheet music, then returns to flip Cartman off.] Aw, man, this is gonna be a long-ass day. [the front door opens and in walks Wendy with her sheet music. She walks to the piano player, gives it to him--]
[moves the mic away] No way!
Okayokay, fine. Wow me.
Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. [Wendy is angered]
Dude, she's a chick!
"Nobody's gonna notice"?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?! [Wendy looks down at her chest]
Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!
Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?
We have to rehearse all that we can! [moves away] Now, check this out: [returns with a box of clothes and sets it on the floor] My mom made us costumes!
Yeah. [starts handing out the costumes] This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... [she looks a little embarrassed]
'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.
[looks back blankly] ...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--
You can't be the tough one, you're Jewish!
Since when?!
Alright, fine! Here! [tosses the tough costume at Kyle, knocking him down] Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! [moves away. The band dresses. Kenny is a baseball player, Stan is a fighter pilot, Cartman is an Elvis impersonator, Kyle is a tough dude with nose ring and Fu Manchu mustache]
I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you... [waves his finger around] pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.
[testy] Okay, Kenny, what does "fingerbang" mean, then?
...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!
[leading the band members through the mall] Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!
We're goin' to see the mall manager.
[pleading] But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do, [the veteran guard pulls out a small bottle of pepper spray and shakes it up] so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the-- [the veteran guard sprays his face all over] Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-dammit..! [squeezes his eyes shut and rubs them]
Oh, God, I can't see! [rubs his eyes]
[coughs a few times] The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! [all join him down the mall]
[over the PA system] Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. [crowds rush off to get their Nissans]
Alright, guys, here we go. [enters the office with the others] Hello, sir!
We... are Fingerbang!
We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?
Alright! Let's do it, boys! [moves aside and sets the boom box down, then sets the tape to play. He returns to the group, and they begin. All of them are all off-key, They all sing too ahead of the music and Wendy's voice is squeaky and lags behind the others...]
[goes into his solo, and back into his dream]
--you're my fantasy, you fanta--
[backs up into the band] Well, so can we play here?
No??
Why not?!
You don't think we're any good, do you?!
Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. [goes to get his boom box]
[eyes downcast] Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems.
I just don't know what I'm gonna do. [lets himself in] Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. [goes to the sofa and pulls out some Cheesy Poofs to eat]
Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean, [with feeling] I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? [the woman sits on Chef's left side and strokes his arm]
What's the Gomlich effect?
So how do boy bands use that?
Thanks!
Okay. [Chef watches as Cartman drops down and heads for the front door, exits...]
[outside] Cucumber in the pants. Got it. [and closes the door]
Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, "Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!" Okay?
I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. [Timmy sits in the cameraman's chair]
Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck. [the band walks across the ground in front of the girls]
Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!
Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!
Fine! Who would you go crazy for?
...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer.
Roll camera!
Jesus Christ!
Aaand cut! [music stops] Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!
Oh uh, Kyle has it. [the girls move to Kyle. Cartman walks away]
Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. [crowds of mall shoppers head for the orange smoothie machine]
[enters the manager's office] Hello again!
I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
[retrieves a TV cart with VCR and pops the VCR in. The video pops up] If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! [at first, only the boys' hats are seen, near the play elephants. The camera spins right, then down, and the girls' feet are seen. The camera spins up and left, and finally rests on Timmy]
Uh, god dammit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool. [the camera gets a glimpse of the four girls, then moves off them a second after Cartman appears]
Son of a bitch!
[dead air on tape] You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.
Really? You will?
That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! [a previous recording is shown:]
Aw, Mom!
Where the hell is Stan?!
I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!
Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member.
Yeah. We'll start right away. [the manager walks away. Cartman turns to Kyle] We'll have to do it without him.
Oh, god-dammit!
God dammit! People are walking away! [drops back behind the curtain]
Just another minute.
[stops and looks up] Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard.
Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! [walks off smiling as Stan arrives]
[approaches the manager] Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?
We will! [moves to the front of the stage and addresses the audience] Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, "I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall." [the manager takes offense] And so, without further ado, all five members of the...
[traumatized] No! He can't be dead!
No! We were so close!
But we have to perform!
Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!
Chuh! [only four shoppers remain to clap for them] Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!
Ok-Okay, okay.
Okay, yeah, maybe. [the mall cops walk away] God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us.
I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', "Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!"
Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy. [the stage is empty now, but Cartman returns and looks up] You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. [turns and walks off again]
[as Mackey speaks] Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation. [Stan and Kenny begin to laugh] This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation." [stops]
"It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation [Stan and Kenny begin to laugh] to increase the population of the younger generation."
No no, no. Separation.
[falls off the pew and onto the floor] Ugh!
Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. [runs out after the other two.]
A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?
Yeah, what if we haven't?
Jesus was made of crackers?
So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.
[unconvinced, closes his Bible] Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! [rests his head on his left hand]
[startled] Nno!
But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?
Oh yeah, okay.
Right, I already got that one.
Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins.
No, you're already going to hell.
You are, too!
Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.
What'd we do to Timmy?
Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.
[approaches] How was it?
Huh?
Who's in there?
Well, here goes everything. [walks to the penitent side of the confession box and enters.]
[hesitantly] Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...
And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?
Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.
No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. [Cartman looks up for a response, but nothing happens]
Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week. [the priest grows more concerned and his jaw drops] And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog. [Priest Maxi's worry has turned to anger he's trying to contain] And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of- [an arm tears through the partition and grabs Cartman by the throat] -eh- Ow! [throttles him back and forth] D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow! [the priest pulls him up into the partition a few times] Eh! Oh! Help. [The confession box rocks back and forth] Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!
[the door opens and he falls to the floor] Uh-huh- [Stan and Kenny rush up] Oho! Ohoho.
I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God. [Stan and Kenny get afraid] He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.
[points the hose at Kyle] Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!
Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
What?
Oh, now you've said it, too!
Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again.
Ugh. Oh, I know. [runs away, but returns with an attachment] We can use Wacky Water Weasel! [sets everything up, and the Weasel sets to work spraying Timmy, Kyle, and Ike.]
And he never took Communion!
Yeah. [the kids make their way slowly across the street]
Come on, hurry up! [Stan reaches the door]
[moves in and tries to open it] What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!
I'm first, I'm first! [trips Token and runs past Stan. Token quickly gets up and walks with the others. Cartman opens the penitent door and sees a woman with her exposed ass up against the partition]
[closes the door] What the? [opens the priest's door. Priest Maxi, in a sexual act with the woman on the other side, looks out and grins. The kids look back in horror, and his face changes]
You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!
Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!
We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh! [Chef and Mr. Garrison arrive] If thy hand offend thee, cut it off! [Stan's parents and the nun are there] It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-
Sister Anne
Stan
There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!
I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! [a group of adults gathers just outside the rear school doors. Kyle joins Cartman on the platform...]
Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was [throws himself down face-first] smacked down by the Lord-uh! [rises] God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh! [kids gasp, adults go glum] But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides, [Kyle has left and now returns with an easel with a picture of a church on it] so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya [near the top of the left-side wall] to this part hmya. [the grass down below] Who will help us?
Praise God-uh!
This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.
Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. [the boys turn left and walk towards Cartman's house]
No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!
This is a distraction from our work on the church! [grabs a doughnut] Do not think that you can tempt us with toys [takes a bite out of his doughnut] and new games [munches away] and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with! [finishes the doughnut off] Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!
Let us get back to our work at the church. [the phone rings] Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah. [answers it] Hello?
[grins mischievously, then] Oh my God!!
It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!
Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!
[on stage wielding a Bible] Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh. [the kids gasp] It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh. [the kids are frightened] He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish.
He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!
And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!
[quite animated, hops twice] We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! [points]
Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!
The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!
Let us pray. [an organ is played] Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.
Let's see... Matthew 15:11. "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man." That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. [Sister Anne approaches]
Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. [Liane leaves]
Sister, have you read this book?
Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.
Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?
We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! [resumes his work]
Well...
Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?
Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh! [smacks him on the face] Theah!
Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
Praise the Lord-uh!
For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person! [Timmy rolls up in his wheelchair] This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!
We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
Devil be [smacks him on the face] gone-uh!
Now walk, Timmih! [turns away dramatically, with eyes closed]
[turns away, then back] Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!
The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! [turns away dramatically, with eyes closed]
He walks-uh!
Yes! Praise the Lord!
For he is Lord
And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?
Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! [smacks the boy in the face and knocks him out]
For he is Lord
He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at! [smacks her on the face] Bah!
[moonwalks] Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say "Amen!"
Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar! [The clapping stops as confused faces appear in the congregation, and the music quiets a bit. Stan and Kyle look at each other as Cartman goes for the collection box] So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah, [sets the box at center stage] and putting a dollar in the box-ah! [kids begin to approach the stage] Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! [rolls on his back as the donations come in]
[offscreen] Yeess. [the camera looks at him, now rolling around shirtless in $1 bills, now grabbing a bunch and bathing in them] Yeess. [sees Stan and Kyle] It worked, you guys, it actually worked!
Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!
Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars! [grins big] Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.
It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.
Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.
My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!
[rolls around in the money] Suck my balls!
Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! [Sister Anne enters the church]
Sister Anne is a blasphemer!
[worried] Uh-oh.
[tugs on Jesus' robs, then softly] Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay.
[goes for the collection box again] Ee-yes, by doing that, [brings it out] and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!
[on his knees] No, come back! You face everlasting damnation! [the last congregant leaves the church] Wait! No! No! [pounds the floor with his fists a few times] I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!
You're gonna send me to hell?
[sees Kenny] Aw, crap!
Yeah, [punches the boy down] get out of here! [withdraws]
There, that's better.
U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her. [Kevin arrives]
[softly] Why, that's PERfect!
[takes a seat] Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?
[chuckles, leaps up on his desk, and moons Ms. Choksondik] KISS MY ASS!!! [no one else moves a muscle, as they are still awed by the teacher's appearance. Cartman looks left, then right...] Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.
[with his back still to Ms. Choksondik] Oh, I'm sure I do.
I'm trying.
[pulls his pants up and sits down again] Fantastic, then.
You guys are all such pussies!
Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
[wistfully] I wish I was still there.
Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.
Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!
Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.
[hops up on his seat] Suck my balls!!! [no one else moves] Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-
We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!
Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen? [a handheld controller with two thumb joysticks is activated. The two nerds get to work]
We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! [the wheelchair is launched and Timmy moves towards the chalkboard]
You're damn right they do!
Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?
Who the hell cares?!
God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!
Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me.
Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck [the contraption is shown and the duck quacks.] Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? [the nerds activate their controllers]
There it is! Come on, everybody! [the kids move towards the portal]
No way, lady!
You can suck my balls!
...What?
Touché, teacher. Touché.
What??
[walks up with his own folder] Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000. [slight pause. Kyle reacts] Yeah, well, [opens his up] it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's, [opens it up again] flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar.
Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.
He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. [soft music plays and Cartman starts to dance]
Yeah, that's me.
Yeahhh, you already know about it?
Well... [mocking] "Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"
[stick the notebook out] Here, Kyle. [Bill stares at Cartman's Trapper Keeper]
And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically. [Kyle glares at him with arms crossed.] I can take something as simple as this calculator [a Wellington Bear model] and... Trapper Keeper?
Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.
And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.
Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers. [wiggles them outstretched] If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands.
Oh really? [hands the folder over to Kyle] Then, why don't you hold it? [Kyle looks at it in Cartman's outstretched hand.] Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it. [inches closer and whispers] Hold it.
[inches closer and whispers] Hold it.
I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.
Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me.
Okay, that's cool.
A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some-- [by this time, "Bill" has pulled away from the pole and Cartman, and has the tether taut and ready to release]
Ugh..! ["Bill" goes after the Trapper Keeper and runs away with it]
Ey!
You son of a bitch! [recalls something] Wait a minute. [whips out a small gadget and activates it] Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. [walks towards the source of the sound heard in the device and away from his friends]
Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!
[grabs Barbrady's ] It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if-- [spots "Bill"] There he is!
Got ya! [grabs the steering wheel from Barbrady]
Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?
[takes his place] Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.
[long pause] You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?
What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!
Aw, damnit! [throws his Trapper Keeper to the ground] Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! [walks off to his left sadly]
[walks up with another Trapper Keeper] Hey, dudes.
Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one! [holds it up high] So everything worked out.
Why the hell not?!
Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!
[holds his Trapper Keeper close] But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home. [moves off to his left]
Ech! Screw you guys. Home. [walks away]
Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away.
Oh, cool.
[softly] Whoa...
Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!
Screw you guys, screw you guys
Huh? [walks towards his computer]
Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now? [cables come from the monitor and grab him] Ugh--!
[à la HAL 9000] What are you doing, Kyle?
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.
Hey, screw you.
Agh--! [four metallic arms from all directions reach out to trap him, then six more organic ones come in to secure him]
Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home.
Awww, man...
Alright, alright. [sighs] Kyle...
[in the second front row, directing] Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines!
No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!
God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!
How good?
Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!
Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too.
That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!
This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever!
Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks.
Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey! [Timmy's turkey sidles in with its head on the ground. Kyle and Timmy follow] What the hell is that?
And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?
[looks at Kyle for a long time] Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second? [they walk off to one side of the stage and stop, out of earshot] Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?
You say, "No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!"
Cool! Can you get it for us?
No no! [tosse another sheet over his shoulder, to join other wads on the floor. His mother enters the room]
I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!
[whining a bit] But [turns around] Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.
[spins around and gets back to work] Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to "Phantom Of The Opera"?! [looks at a small portrait of Helen Keller on his desk, picks it up and studies it] Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice. [after looking at the portrait some more, he gets frustrated and slams the portrait onto the desk] Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!
[in the audience] OP-pression!
Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?
Yeh.
Whoa.
Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody! [the kids move back...] Where the hell is Timmy?
Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey. [Timmy takes his lighter and sets his hoop on fire, then lowers it for his bird]
No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!
No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.
Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! [Alinicia protests vigorously, shedding feathers everywhere]
Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!
[walks up] Dude, we need your turkey for our play!
I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?
I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.
Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show? [laughs, but realizes he's alone in this] Oh.
Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything. [walks off]
Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second. [whisks himself onstage] Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2 [starts moving Gobbles along] stand just a little bit more over... [puts it behind the Comedy Central logo] here. [mulls over the position] Let's see, maybe a little more up in here. [moves it a bit towards stage center] And just a wee bit over here. [Gobbles is back behind the logo, a bit] And right about... [moves Gobbles a bit back] hm'ere. [steps back] There we go. Good. [goes off stage. A cable whips out of place somewhere. A lighting fixture falls on Kenny and kills him]
Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!
[Jeffrey continues his dirge] Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work! [looks at Lamond] All of us! [Lamond crosses his arms]
Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see. [writes] no [writes] No. [writes] NO! [writes] God-damnit [takes the sheet and squeezes it into a wad]
Terrible! [turns and faces Jeffrey] I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.
Like what?
Hey, that's not a bad idea.
Oh, man!
No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.
Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire! [starts writing furiously] Yes! Yes! I have it now!
[cheerfully] Alright everybody, let's take our places!
I don't know. [Stan and Kyle cross their arms] I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.
[rushes up] Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights.
Union Mafia bastards! [Timmy looks at Lamond in fear]
Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
...Alright, fine! Get in costume!
What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
[walks up with Kyle] Okay, we're ready for the- [stops in his tracks and stares at the dead Alinicia.] What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!
[exults] They loved it! They LOVED it!
That's it?
I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?
Whoa! That totally surprised me! [his mom looks at him] I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.
[sweetly] Mom.can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball? [grins]
God, I have to everything around here!
I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the- [blinks and looks up. In the living room now with his mom are Stan's parents, Kyle's parents, Mr. Mackey, Mr. Garrison, and Dr. Doctor.] What the hell's going on?
[incredulous] What?!
You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!
Fat camp?
Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this, [grabs his creation and drops the plate on the floor] but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!
[pleading] Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!
Well, I'm pissed off!, Rick! How are you?
[darkly] Don't touch me! [moves away a bit]
No.
[miffed] Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
[resumes jogging] This... is... bullcrap!
[in withdrawal] I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.
[shoves his plate to the boy] Take it! I can't eat this crap!
[to the girl] Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass.
Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!
Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free. [sees the entrance and races for it. He exits and races through the meadow until he reaches a road.] We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run? [an ice cream truck approaches him] An ice cream truck! Hey wait! [races up to the truck. The driver exits the cab] Boy, am I glad to see you!
You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!
Hunh? [is lifted up] Uuh! [and tossed into the truck. The doors are closed behind him, and he looks up. Before him sit four other kids who have tried to escape]
[stands up] Aw, God-damnit! [turns] LET ME OUT OF HMYA! [pounds on the back doors]
Memememeee! [the group heads for the kitchen while Stan and Kyle stay behind]
Is anyone starting to suspect anything?
Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!
What?!
Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.
[soft gasp] Suck my balls, 20!
Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed! [the new Cartman looks trapped]
[turns around] Alright, they're gone! [walks to his bed and pulls out a suitcase from underneath] The Cartman store is open! [the other kids leave their bunks and head for Cartman]
[quickly as he hands the goods over] Two donuts and a pack of licorice. [she walks away,and a big, tall boy is next] Well, Tony, the usual? [Tony, with squinty eyes, blinks and Cartman gives him the usual. Tony walks away. Another boy walks up, crying] Why are you crying, Chad?
[comforts Chad] Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend.
Yes. [dangles a chocolate in front of him] A chocolate friend. [Chad begins to howl] Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are. [opens the wrapper to expose the aroma and tempts him] Look at how yummy and sweet he is. [Chad, still sobbing, takes the candy bar and starts eating. Cartman bides his time] ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars. [Chad hands him the money and finishes the candy bar. Cartman just watches] ...There you go.
[off to one side] ...65, 66, 67... [counting the dollars he's collected during his stay]
[through gritted teeth] Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!
You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! [grins hopefully]
What?!
Well, screw you, fatasses! [begins sobbing, and pulls out a donut from his pocket. He eats at it between sobs.]
No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!
Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!
Well, I guess you're screwed, then. [walks away with the other two]
[smoothly] Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.
Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.
Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.
I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.
You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like, [slight whine] "my parents molestered me."
No, but you've gotta cry, like this: [starts a fake sob, rubs his eyes] "My parents molestered me." [stops the fake cry] And then they'll say something like, "Was it a good touch or a bad touch?" and you say [rolls his eyes as he thinks] "Uh, it was a good touch" or- no wait, [points] you say it was a bad touch.
Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer "bad touch."
Yeah, And cry. [Kyle lets out a soft cry] Oh, he's ready.
Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!
[slides up in front of the others] You guys! Come out here! [walks out the door. The other two follow, leaving Ike alone on the sofa.]
Notice anything? [before them the town sits empty as the sun sits between two mountains in a red sky.] Watch. [takes a stone and throws it hard. It flies through the air and goes through a first-floor window on a building two blocks away]
Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town. [more kids gather] They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please? [Mark and Linda look at each other] Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions.
Parents? [his left-hand assistant (Francis) whispers in his ear and withdraws] Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around.
Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!
Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.
[opens up an empty jar and speaks into it] Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. [closes the lid on the jar as Francis waits on him and hands the jar to Francis. He hops down and goes out the door]
[tosses the jar aside, and it breaks] So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too. [moves a plate of treats forward] Ringy-ding?
Aaahh! [jumps from his chair a second before a huge spitball crashes through the window and lands on the floor. He picks himself off the floor and goes to look out the window angrily] You sons of bitches! [turns to the couple] You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. [Mark and Linda, both unsure, look at each other]
Where is your husband?
Seize her! [the others move forth]
[outside] Outlander! [all look in the direction of the sound]
Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!
Butters, calm down, alright?
I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it! [gives her a small shock]
Heh, heheh.
We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!
The Provider awakes!
Aw, damnit! Alright. [gets formal] It is decided. [points, in normal voice] Butters, your turn. [other kids back away. Tweek and another boy take Butters away.]
Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too.
Take him down. [Tweek and the other three unchain Butters]
Snow igloos kick ass. [Mark and Linda stare as if the events of the last ten days didn't leave an impression on the boys]
Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed. [turns aside and walks off]
Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?
Heh-tchoo!
Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!
Family?
My moms barely bought me any presents so far.
Anything for more presents!
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until- [a couple walks past] God-damnit! [a man walks past in the other direction] Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole! [a woman walks by]
Oh, Jesus, not this thing again.
Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.
My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!
Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!
[points] Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat.
What?!
I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT! [Butters sets the poster on the desk, face up]
You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?
...deh..OOOWW!!!
[grins] Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks.
[throws his headphones off] Don't call me fat, buttfucker.
Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold!
Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways! [walks off and stops at the door] Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!
[enters victoriously] Thank you, thank you. [Stan and Kyle look at him annoyed]
What are you talkin' about, "quit"? Huh! I don't remember that.
I guess- we might as well- go home now. [the boys leave and Mr. Hankey wilts]
Yeah, ham.
Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!
Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.
Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.
[off-screen, but rushes in] You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!
I was just- [looks stung, then flashes an angry look at Kyle] I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.
So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama.
No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television.
You'll never guess.
Guess.
You ready? [focus on Cartman] Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say, [looks both ways] "Shit."
It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude.
Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said "shit" on television!
Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?
Goddamn it! When are they gonna say "shit"?!
I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.
Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!
Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?
Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.
[quizzically] Huh?
I don't get it.
Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!
Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina.
Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of "shit". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob. [licks his Popsicle]
You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than "shit", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. [Kyle rushes in with Kenny behind him]
[dismissive] Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob.
Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.
[points to Kyle] Detective Sandy Vagina here [Kyle looks angrily at Cartman] thinks that "shit" might have something to do with everyone getting sick.
You guys, look here. [the others move over to see] In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.
So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb. [laughs]
Oh-Ho, gross!
Kenny's got it. heh heh.
[brushes himself off] Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!
But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?
I knew it! Meecrob! [the word is shown in close-up] Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do!
My house, too?
[as the geldon sets more fires] Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina! [one knight's horse's tail is on fire.]
What a stupid voice.
[camera cuts to him] So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language. [murmurs and a smattering of applause come from the audience.]
Hah, I love you guys.
That's not funny! Jesus Christ!
Yeah, he's excited.
[flatly] Hey, Butters.
Hey, yeah!
Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale.
Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.
Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch.
Hehe, I don't sound like that.
Cripple fight! [the other boys cheer, but Mr. Grazier bursts through the doors]
Awww!
[to Kenny] Man, this guy sucks.
Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!
But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.
[moves over to her] Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do! [takes her box and looks inside, then tosses it away. She goes after the box]
Cripple fight!
Cripple fight! [after a moment, the congregants get up and leave]
[on speakers] Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have... cripple fight. Cripple fight outside! [the shoppers abandon their carts and exit]
Eh, we kick ass.
[walking up] Who's this asshole?
Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?
Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!
When are we gonna learn magic tricks?
Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?
Cool.
[thinking he's indistinguishable] Heheh, guess who I am, guys?
Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.
[giggles] Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you.
Cool. [the woman shows the boys in]
Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?
Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.
He's going to eat his own head.
Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.
No you're not.
No you're not.
No you're not.
No you're not.
Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.
Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. [turns right and walks down the street. Kyle looks back at Stan for a few seconds, then follows Cartman. Stan turns and walks down the street in the same direction Kyle and Cartman were walking, but stops when a car appears in front of him. He sees some adult Blaintologists inside. The driver starts the car and moves towards Stan, who turns about face and begins to run with his bike. The car looms behind him and he lets go of his bike.]
What's he doin' here? [Jesus goes on stage]
Now how the hell did he do that? [Blaine simply extends his right arm, lifts the bread and fish mentally from the cart and drops them over by Stan]
[jubilant] Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!
[sits up abruptly, knocking Kyle off the bed] No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? [now alert, if confused, and Kyle stands up]
[sighs silently] Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?
What?
Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either. [points to his groin] I haven't even gotten my pubes yet.
That co- ugh. [drops to a whisper] That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning.
I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.
This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.
Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.
At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!
Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die! [pushes the dome into the pool]
[brings the hose over] But it's the only way for us to be happy. [plugs the hose into the dome and releases the water]
[trying to drown himself from the edge of the Reflecting Pool] Bliegh! [rises. His body is on land] Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep [dunks his head in the water again].
Hey, I was just about to do it.
Oh, that's so sweet you guys. [Stan and Kyle are not amused] You wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while? Heheheheheh [Kyle turns and kicks Cartman in the groin, knocking him down]
[Stan kicks him] Ah! [Kyle's turn] Ow, stop it! [Stan's turn] Ah! [they continue taking turns kicking Cartman in the groin — Roshambo!]
Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
[coolly] Oh, nothing. No big deal, really.
Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.
Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! [dances]
Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
You wanna see 'em?
[reaches into his pants] Here, check 'em out.
There, see?! How do you like them apples! [in his right hand is a clump of pubic hair. The other boys look, with Kyle ready to cover his eyes again] HA!
My pubes.
I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. [sing-song] Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha! [dances a little more]
[moves in between Stan and Kyle and embraces them, one under each arm, and gloats. Kyle looks at Cartman's right hand] Don't be jealous, guys. [Kyle looks at Cartman] This doesn't mean we can't still hang out. [Kyle looks back at Cartman's hand] It just means that I matured faster than you. [Kyle fears for that hair touching him] You'll get your pubes guys, someday.
Uh oo what?
Nuh uh!
[looks at his purchase] But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?
You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
[walks off in a huff] Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.
Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?
Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!
Just give me back my money...
Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!
[in costume, with briefcase] Hello, sir, my name is Kris
[thinks a bit] Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you...
You will? Oh, cool!
Oh. Uh, lessee. [pulls out some money] I only got six dollars and twelve cents.
...Okay.
Right.
Cool.
Sweet! [the door closes] Uh. Oh, goddamnit!
That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!
What?!
He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!! [the boys reach the box office and buy their tickets]
One please. [with no money, he tries to pay with pubic hair. Nothing happens for a while]
O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?
Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes.
Racist! [takes the pubes and runs off]
Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!
[stunned] What?
[softly] Wha-? Uh oo [audibly] why do you want then back so much?
I don't believe you.
Pube fair?
Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!
Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!
Haha, charade you are, Scott! [runs away quickly]
[cuts through the line] Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha! [enters the bus]
Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!
Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir.
Can you tell me where the pube fair is?
Yeah, I have some pubes to sell.
No- no such thing?
I'm Eric Cartman!
[screams] Aaah!!!
A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here
Alright, Scott, you win. I give up.
Yeah, I'll see you around. [walks down the steps and towards the street, but stops] Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...
[turns around] Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down.
Yeah. Poor grandma...
[evilly, to himself] Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh. [turns around and returns to the house. Scott returns]
Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott! [Scott withholds the money]
What?
Huh?
Why??
[looks around to make sure no one else is watching, then quickly] Please Scott give me my money.
I beg you to give me back my money.
What?!
[looks around] I'm a little piggy.
[points to his nose] Here's my snout.
Oink oink oink.
[looks back angrily for a few seconds, then]
What- What are you doing?? [the bills light up and burn from one end to the other. Scott lets the burning bills float away] No!.. wuh...why?
[yells] Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!
[descending the stairs] Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming. [walks to the easel] I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all! [Clyde raises his hand] Yes, Clyde!
[correcting Kyle] Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!
Did you guys see that movie "Hannibal"? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony [flips the first page over to reveal a drawing of a pony and takes up the pointer with his left hand], we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener. [the other kids just stare back, but Cartman continues] It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!
What?
Oh, right. Why should we care? [slaps the pointer into his right hand] Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, "It's not your problem." But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, "You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!" [flips to the next page, which has written on it "$16.12" with double underline] Now who's with me?!! [turns around to find only one other person in the basement]
[slaps his forehead and sighs] Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!
There we go. [stands aside] Come and get it. [camera pulls back to reveal a pony nearby] ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it. [the pony looks, then approaches] Come on, good pony. That's it! [the pony sniffs the wiener] Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony! [the pony bares its teeth... only to start licking the wiener] Oh no, pony, he'll like that.
No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. [by this time, the pony is sucking on the wiener]
He said it was okay.
Because [ominously] of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!
[noticing the sucking] Not like that, pony! [slaps the wiener out of its mouth]
Whattayou mean?
How do I do that?
I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!
Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!
You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner...
So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a [British accent] li'l ol' scheme [normal] that involves them.
Whoa!
I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.
Radiohead. Yes, of course. [drops down]
[cheerfully] Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?
Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown. [gloats] Everyone's gonna be there!
You're welcome, Scott. [turns and walks away]
Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? [activates the screen and then walks off stage]
[has taped over the band's answers with his own — first as Thom Yorke] That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid. [now as Johnny Greenwood] Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too. [Now as Ed O'Brien] I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?
Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? [Scott looks down, and ponders Cartman's role]
[Now as Phil Selway] Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to. [Now as Thom Yorke] Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!
Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott. [Scott is gone] Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA! [feedback is heard] What a retard! [the kids around him face right] And now everyone saw it! [looks around]
[on screen] '"I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink."' [the kids begin to laugh hard, then harder. The same clip is shown over and over, and Kenny begins to laugh. Soon he can't control himself, and falls over dead. His ghost appears and continues laughing]
[seething with anger] That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!
Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!! [goes into whispers and brings out a protractor and a compass] Then... that... [finishes his plan] Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!! [a truly evil grin appears on his face.]
Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!
How to get Scott Tenorman back!
I just finished planning a brilliant [British accent] li'l scheme [normal] that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. [holds out two fingers]
It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?
So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! [camera pulls back to reveal the setup: pony, scarecrow with wiener attached to groin]
Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!! [laughs demonically] Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! [nothing happens for a few seconds]
...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!! [walks over to the pony] Ready, pony? [the pony nods] Bite it! [the pony bites off a piece of the wiener] Yes!! [exults]
[with tickets in hand] Hello, Scott!
I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides. [shows him the face of the ticket] Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!
[getting smug] Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott. Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!
Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.
[under his breath] A little penis-biting, perhaps?
Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?
Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott. [Scott turns around and closes the door] Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. [leaves]
[steps out of the ticket booth to greet them] Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!
[smug] Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!
What's so funny?
Not yet, but they will be.
Hey, Chef.
What contest?
Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.
[seeing Scott, interrupts. Slowly and sweetly] Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! [Scott holds a small container of chili]
[overjoyed] Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!
Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.
[sighs silently] Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first. [Scott leaves] Goddamnit!
[inspecting the dish] Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. [hands his plate to Scott, who takes it to his end of the table and starts eating]
Alright. [takes the dish and starts eating. Both boys munch away for a few moments] Hey, this is great! [Stan and Kyle stifle giggles]
[begins to wolf down the food] Gawh, this is really good, Scott!
What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? [Everyone at Scott's end of the table is shocked, even Scott, at this accusation]
Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's. [Chef looks like he's been used] It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap. [Stan and Kyle are stunned] I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area. [A shot of Cartman telling Denkins of such a thing. Denkins is armed] I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents. [A shot of Scott talking with his parents] And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. [The Tenormans are in the corral to rescue the "starving" pony, but upon seeing Mr. Tenorman's lit flashlight, Mr. Denkins fires at them, and they go down]
I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies... [A shot of Cartman arriving, seeing Denkins and Barbrady, and pulling the bodies away. The pony munches at some grass] After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili. [more faces of horror behnd Cartman] Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott? [A gleefully evil look comes over Cartman] I call it, "Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."
[leaping up on the table and sings] Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! [Stan and Kyle are way stunned]
[walks over to Scott's end of the table] Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott! [starts licking Scott's tears off his face] Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.
Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy. [licks the tears off the table and off Scott's face.] Mm-yummy you guys! [the iris common to Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons appears, with fanfare] Yuppitibut, that's all, folks! [waves]
Whoa, bummer, dude.
Are you sure? I haven't seen it.
[running in circles] You guys! Hey you guys! You guys!
Awesome! Give me mine! [Kyle gives them out]
Well yeah, dude.
Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!
I think this new guy's funny.
Aw, dude, gay!
Racist! [a boy wearing glasses watches the foursome approach. The boys fall in]
Don't talk to us, kid.
Kenny's a random slut. [a look of anger flashes across Kenny's face]
Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there! [Terrance and the woman stand up]
Weak.
Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!
Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.
We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us.
Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!
Alright!
[rolling Kenny over so he can see] Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!
Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday.
Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?
[softly] God! She didn't take this long to die.
Great. Now can we go?
Ogh! God-damnit..!
[impatient, arms crossed] Mom, I wanna go home!
Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...
[under his breath] Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!
[stunned] Hoosajiggawha?
Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?
No, no, wait, you don't understand. [voice trembles] since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars...
Egh... [lets out four long screams while his family watches]
[softly] Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface.
I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.
On my dream. [zoom in] On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...
Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it.
Huh, I think God has plenty of money.
Not much, just taking my [stops the wagon and shows a stack of bill off] one million dollars out of the bank. [the other three boys are stunned]
Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.
HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!
Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!
My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.
What?!
Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.
No no! I'm buying it to keep people out! [Chris and Frank look at each other] Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks. [zoom in] But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds, [shot of people waiting to enter "The Mine Shaft"] The rides are great, but... [a shot of crowds on Main Street] All the lines, lines, LINES! [shot of people waiting to enter a ghost ride, another shot of a kids' mine shaft ride; another of Cartman pissed off, eyes squeezed shut, with waiting times floating past him] If there's one thing I hate, [a shot of two lines of people entering his head] all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!! [opens his eyes, and a moment later...] And then there get to be so many people [his eyes roll around independently of each other] that they make FastPass. [a shot of people in a FastPass line] So then there's lines for FastPass. [zoom out to show Cartman in line for a FastPass] You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms [two lines for the Waterworks Restrooms], lines for the drinks [Astro Food line], lines for cantakuras [Seussian characters play strange instruments for the people in line] and rare Kartankulas Plinks! [a vendor sells them - they are a fruit treat shaped like strawberries] ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.
Gentlemen, I thank you.
[gleefully] Yyeessss! Yyeessss! [next, "Java Jam!!" a Teacup ride. Cartman laughs to himself] Awesome! [continues laughing. Next shot: Cartman in the "Bumper Buggies" bumper cars] Ho ho! [bumps into the car before him] Sweet! [bumps into the car behind him] Yes! [next shot: Cartman announcing at the Mine Shaft Ride] Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft! [pulls the lever and the cars pull away. Cartman rushes to jump in the first car and buckles in. Outside, the cars go to one end of the ride] Yes! [the cars go to the other end of the ride] Yes! [next shot, goes to "Ride Shots: pictures of your ride"] Oh, cool! [a picture of him on the ride appears on one screen] Oh, look how much fun I had! [next shot: a haunted ride. First, a mummy pops out of a casket to his right] Whoa! Heheheheh. [a skeleton pops out to his right] Ah! Heheh. [a ghost pops on from his left] Whoa! Heh, heheh. [next shot, Cartman on a ferry around an island] Woooo, Adventure Island! Check it out! Awesome! [the island seems to have real animals there, like giraffes, elephants. Next shot, Cartman on a log ride, "The Yeti." He goes down the chute] Yoohoo! Yeh-hehess! [lands in the lake below] Yehess! [comes to the end of the ride, sobs joyfully] I'm so happy! I'm so happy..!
[voice, from the TV] Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides [Cartman stands next to a Yeti. When the log car comes out, he jumps in and takes off], six roller coasters [one of them is shown], and tons of great surprises! [a haunted tree and the Yeti do their stuff. Cartman is back at the front gate] And the best part is: [zoom in] You can't come!! [Stan and Kyle look confused. Next shot: Cartman on Main Street] That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister [a shot of the fancy new ride, with Cartman in one of the cars, going through the loops], a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow! [an overview of Adventure Island, with Cartman showing it off] It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!! [a shot of Cartman landing in a space capsule, with parachute] So come on down to Cartmanland now! [Cartman in the Haunted Mansion ride] But don't plan on getting past the parking lot, [back at the front gate] 'cause remember: [cue music] So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come! [cut music] Especially you, Stan and Kyle.
[a mommy pops out of a casket to his right] Whoa! Heheh. [a skeleton pops out to his right] Whoa! [a ghost pops on from his left] Whoa! Heheheheheh. [he exits the ride and ambles back to the road] Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.
[lifts his hand to his ear to hear better] What the hell?
You sons of bitches! [goes towards the source of the sound]
[arriving] What the hell are you doing?!
[reaches the scene, but stays inside the park] That's right! You stay out!
...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!
Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.
[looks warily at the guard] But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line.
Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.
But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.
Ugh... Two people?
Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...
Sweet.
[on the bullhorn] Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day. [turns it off]
I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.
The rest of you will just have to try another day.
'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir. [Butters gives him the money and gets back change, his ticket, and a map of the park] Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.
...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland. [Clyde leaves] Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides. [walks in and dances down Main Street] Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again! [enters the ride and makes his way through the line] Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah- [finds Clyde and Butters waiting for the ride as well. They turn to see him] What are you doing?
Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? [Clyde and Butters lean away from Cartman, a bit afraid]
Ugh, alright, alright, hang on. [pulls out a walkie-talkie and speaks into it] Security!
Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.
But I don't know how it works.
Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.
[on the bullhorn] Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day. [a shot of the crowd from the front, then one of Cartman] However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood? [everyone nods] Alright, let's go. [unhinges the velvet rope, and in walk Token, Timmy, Filmore and friend, Kenny, two adults, Bebe, and another boy]
[eyes the new boy and stops him] Wait a minute! Who are you?
HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!
I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!
Get him out of here! [Stan looks up in surprise]
Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides! [smiles and walks into the park. Next shot, Cartman in a roller coaster. Next, Cartman on "Plummet from the Summit"] Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared! [reaches the top of the ride, then the car goes into free fall] AAAGGGHHH....
[checking off items on a clipboard] ...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day... [the clipboard reads, "Cartmanland Expenses."] Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to... [under his breath] God-damnit! [picks up the bullhorn and says] Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! [the crowd hoots and hollers and surges forward, engulfing Cartman. The people rush towards the one open ticket booth]
[Bumped from ahead by car #9, Clyde] Eh! [Bumped from ahead by car #4, Kevin] Goddamnit, stop running into me! [at the Mine Shaft Ride he sits in the fist car, but is not enjoying it with all those other kids. Kenny is in the last car]
AGH! [he's next in The Yeti log ride with older kids] DAAGGHHHH!!
[approaches] Hey, there you are! [The two men see him]
Just give me my money back.
I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!
You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!
GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! [scares the hell out of the boy. The father holds on to the boy]
Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! [three men in suits approach Cartman]
[turns to face them] Yeah?
He-hey, that's my money!
What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!
Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!
No! But I don't... ah... ah... [sees Mr. Fun through a fence and rushes to talk to him] Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.
But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!
This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!
It isn't fair! [throws another stone] You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair! [throws another. Stan arrives with the doctor, the nurse, Kyle, and Kyle's parents]
You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?! [throws another stone]
I'M SO PISSED OFF! [the security guard arrives, ready to spray Cartman]
Ey! You used to work for me! [the guard sprays Cartman in the face] Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch! [coughs and wheezes. Stan grins and Kyle's vital stats get stronger. Kyle sighs]
Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!
It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie! [Kyle looks at Cartman, then up at the sky, then sits up and removes the oxygen mask]
[runs up excitedly] Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!
No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! [goes away, and Stan and Kyle follow]
Watch this. It's sooo funny. [grins] Come 'ere, dog, come on. [giggles as he starts pleasing the dog] Good dog. [the dog rolls over on its back and Cartman starts stroking the dog's penis] Red rocket red rocket. [Stan and Kyle look at each other. Kenny starts to laugh and clap, and the dog's penis lengthens] Red rocket. Red rocket. [chuckles] Come on. [giggles]
I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
[continues milking] Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it. [concentrates on the dog] Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket! [the dogs ejaculates, and the semen lands on Cartman's face] Ohooohhh!
I told you guys.
[sighs] Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.
[rolls his eyes up] That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off. [looks at Kenny] Don't you guys know anything?
Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here! [laughs as a gray dog approaches]
AIDS?
Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.
Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!
Just put it on, Butters.
Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?
I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!
Do you feel protected?
Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier. [takes a condom just filled with urine and tosses it at the trashcan. It hits the side and splatters the urine next to the can.]
I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.
So I don't get AIDS.
I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!
Here, talk to them, Butters.
Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.
Oh, bitch!
Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now.
Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy! [a dog enters the scene, and the camera begins to zoom out. Everyone is smiling and looking on as Cartman pleases the dog] That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now.
Let a man take a crap!
[from behind the bathroom door] I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that? [finishes wiping his butt and zips himself up. He comes out of the bathroom with something in his hands] You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.
Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.
[holds it up] Look. [Sharon gasps and drops the laundry. Cartman unravels it] But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. [looks through it]
Why?
[inspects it] Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive.
This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?! [hick accent] You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.
Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!
Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. [the boys turn away from the window]
Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.
Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.
Bring it, bring it! [on the TV two monsters fight each other. The one on the right attacks the other with a chainsaw. "Oh!"]
[slowly slides into a hick accent] Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih.
Date-rape psychosis.
Awesome!
We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
Yes! Go away, you stupid towel! [Towelie goes away]
That's... so... cool!
It's Monday?
What, dude? [the driver steps on the gas and the car peels away. The passenger soldier looks out the window and back at the boys.]
Come on, man, this isn't funny! [Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman look around and behind the TV] I need my fix! [the phone rings, and Stan goes to answer it.]
[in disbelief, backs up.] No! ...No!
Hey, towel!
Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call. [the others stop, and he calls out in one direction] Gebaayybeh! [then in another] Gebaayybeh!
No it isn't.
No it isn't.
Egh!
This is where you came from?
Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!
Alright, I think we go over there. [the Secret Government Base entrance is shown with Towelie and the boys approaching the gate]
You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!
Yeah, and you're a towel!
We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?
Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.
Could you turn it up?
Hup hup. Come on, hang on. [Stan and Kyle moan]
Kenny!
Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!
Hooray!
You're the worst character ever, Towelie.
...Not really.
Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors.
Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those?
God-damnit! [boards the bus without his scissors]
HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!
Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at war with these assholes!
That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents? [cue soft music. Cartman stands on his seat] Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids. [now standing on his desk] There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault.
Yes, but they're sand monkeys!
[drops into his seat angrily] God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!!
Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off.
Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it.
It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom.
Oh no, not Towelie.
[quickly] No, we don't wanna get high!!
That's right!
[he and the other two peek in] Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?
[turns around and wrestles with the door] Aw, son of a bitch!
[giggles] Uh ho, you guys.
It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting.
Uh, whatever!
Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while!
God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist!
What is this? The freakin' Flintstones?
It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to your crappy country. [the Afghan boys are insulted]
What did you call us?!
I told you! Jawas have no heart.
You know, sand people.
[softly] God, I hate you so much, Stan!
Ey, what the hell are you talking about?! [Stan and Kyle look at Cartman angrily] I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you!
Dude, don't call me a Canadian! [the protesters lead the captives up a mountain road. A bird in a tree warbles an Arabic song. When the lead protester reaches the tree he shoots the bird, and the bird falls down and away, dead. The trek resumes]
Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-
[leaning away] Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive.
I'm gonna go take care of this prick!
He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people. [walks off]
Mehah... [bites on some food] What's up, bin Laden?
Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray. [quickly rushes for a prayer rug and rolls it out, then kneels and bows deeply a few times.] Allah, Allah, m'heh
Uh oh! Mmm-mm! [kisses Osama and tumbles away]
Hey look! An infidel! [bin Laden quickly turns around]
So that's what this is all about?
[climbs up bin Laden and kisses him] Mmmm! Tastes like chicken. The ass of a chicken!
Woohoo! [zips away, leaving a dust cloud front of bin Laden. Bin Laden gives chase, leaving his own dust cloud.]
Haduqaduqaduqa. [Osama's tongue has rolled out to the floor. He tugs it and it rolls up like a classroom projection screen] Huqadukadukadukaduuu. [Osama whistles and then lustily howls like a wolf as he stomps his foot down on the ground. Cartman hops off the camel, walks some distance, and bats his eyes at bin Laden. Osama takes big steps towards Cartman, and the camera alternates between the two. Bin Laden stops short of Cartman... and leaps over him, landing on the camel's neck. Bin Laden starts kissing the camel all over, and Cartman removes his veil, looks at bin Laden, then looks at the camera]
There you are! Where have you been? We have another anti-American video to create! [hauls bin Laden away.]
Hur-ry, get into wardrobe! [bin Laden goes behind the walll and changes clothes. Cartman taps his foot impatiently] Oh hur-ry up, will you hur-ry?! [bin Laden comes out dressed as Uncle Sam] Oh, you look marvelous, dahling.
Come on! The cameras are ready! [pulls bin Laden to his mark. Behind them, eight Taliban soldiers fire away at the Americans] Alright, there we go. Let's roll cameras. [walks off and returns with a director's megaphone and a firecracker] Oh, and here's your microphone. [hands Osama the firecracker]
Yeah. [follows the other two out]
[rushes up, giddily breathless] You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!
Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! [points]. Kenny, Kenny, over here! [Kenny comes in looking as Cartman described, with his hands on the floor and his feet in the air, laughing uncontrollably. After Kenny stands still, Cartman roars with laughter]
Yes it is! [while this is going on, the other kids get their pictures taken, Token being the last one. He hops off the stool and walks away.]
...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny.
Uh oh. [laughs]
Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?
Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!
Heh, c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon!
[bouncing in his seat] YES! YES!
[rushes up and takes Kenny's photos] Let me see! [returns to his seat. Stan and Kyle look at Cartman curiously while Kenny looks on angrily]
[opens Kenny's envelope and looks at the photo, then roars with laughter] Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!
[Laughs] Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! [laughs some more]
Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!
I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.
Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny. [Kenny looks over] I just had the greatest idea... ever!
Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? [stifles a laugh]
Yes, I have it right hmya. [shows her Kenny's school photo]
You will? [tries not to laugh, but some escapes] Ah. [stifles another laugh] Oh, ah, thank you for your help.
Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye. [sniggers, then laughs] Brown eye! [laughs some more under his breath]
And, and big rosy cheeks! [laughs some more]
[cracks up] Full cheeks! [laughs] Winking brown eye, brown eye winking! [cracks up]
[between the laughter] You guys! You guys! You guys! [laughs uncontrollably]
[more laughter] ...You guys!... [more laughter]
[more laughter] You guys! You guys! You guys! Hurry. [hangs up]
Come on. Come on. [whispers] Come on.[leads the way] Oho, this is so sweet! [still laughing as he walks to the sofa and picks up a milk carton] You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet!
Look at, look at the description. Brown eye! [falls to the floor, pounding the carpet with his fists in hysterics]
Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!
No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.
[gets up and hops off the sofa] Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God. [tries to compose himself] Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right? [wipes some moisture from his face] And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid. [cracks up again]
No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! [waits a second, then roars with laughter again]
Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!! [roars with laughter again. The doorbell rings and all three look at the door] Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh. [walks over to answer the door. He stops and stifle a laugh] Just- okay [chuckles] No. [takes a few steps] Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh. [steps to the door, takes a deep breath, and opens it, grinning]
Oh God.
[very softly] Oh my... God. [walks away from the door quite afraid, then begins to ascend the stairs stammering nonsense]
You guys, something's wrong.
I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.
[turns to face them] It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded. [turns away] I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?
Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?
Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.
You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die... [Mr. Mackey is shocked by the last one] This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.
[turns over to look at Mr. Mackey] So does that mean I'll never laugh again?
Ugh.
[out of sorts] Oh, dude, oh.
Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-
Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here! [goes inside, and Jimmy follows, closing the door]
Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.
I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.
Okay, let me have it.
Okay, why?
...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.
Who's there?
Orange who?
[stares back] ...naw, that didn't work either.
Who's there?
An interrupting cow who
Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.
And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.
Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one.
[walking up to the other boys] What's goin' on?
Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck. [breaks into a grin and starts laughing] Ben Assfleck, say that's funny.
Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! [laughs some more.]
A-heh, what?
E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.
[silent sigh] Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny! [Kenny follows Cartman, and they begin to cross the road. Kenny remains behind Cartman, and the sound of a motorcycle draws close]
What's that thing?
What?
Forty bucks?
Alright, alright.
Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?
[pulls back and mulls his chances] Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.
[weakening] ...Oh, man.
[snaps into action] Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here. [at that moment, a large wheel zips by the bus stop, and the kids cover their eyes]
[resisting an urge] Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.
[resisting mightily] I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!
Ugh, ugh!
Oh!
Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!
[offscreen] Kyle, Kyle! [arrives] I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps.
Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.
No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, "Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?" And I was all like, "No way!" And this little light went on in my head like, "Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin." But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan. [Kyle Two gets even angrier] What a misunderstanding, huh? [tries to be chummy with Kyle. Kyle brushes him off]
Goddamnit, give me another chance!
Haha, [slaps him on the back] serves you right, asshole. [leaves]
[leaving] He's faaahn.
[turns toward the landing gear and buried his face in a wheel, then starts counting] 1, 2, 3, 4...
[leaving] He's faaahn.
Heheheheheh. [the door is heard opening and they realize what Kyle just told them]
[steps forth] I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait.
[turns to Kyle] ...Good job, Jew!
[wrapping something together] Stand by, please.
[leaving his seat] Oh, god dammit!
Shutup, Jew! [moves to the clearing, turns around, and faces the class. He clears his throat] Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.
Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!
I'll make you eat your parents!
Nothing! [takes his seat]
Aw, that is such bullcrap!
No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!
Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!
[leaves his seat and walks over to Token] Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we? [tugs at his sweater] Ooooo, Armani Exchange!
All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?! [Token opens his mouth to say something, but shuts it up instead] I didn't think so! [moves back to his seat.]
Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.
Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.
Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently. [the others laugh and gether around Token]
[takes the DVD and holds it up] Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it. [the others laugh]
Oh, Jesus, dude. [Lowers the disk and laughs with the others]
What in the hell are they doing?
Well, let's just play our game, then.
Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! [goes over and kicks Kenny in the nuts - Roshambo has begin!]
Kick his nutsack! [kicks Kyle in the nuts. Stan kicks Kenny in the nuts. Token rides up and stops to watch the boys while the game continues. Soon, a player and horse ram into his and knocks him and his horse away - It's Frederick.]
Uh huh.
Yeah.
Hey.
Ey, you did me already!
[walks past Token, behind Kyle] Pussy. [Pip walks by without saying anything]
[rides along] My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm. [sees the trashed truck and its contents] What do we have heah? [strokes his chin]
Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!
Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?
Better.
Better.
Better.
Thirty-three aborted fetuses. [the boys look back at him for a long time] Oh yes.
Mint condition, tax free.
Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!
Stem cells, numbnuts!
[points at Kyle] It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.
Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!
Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it.
Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?
[rips out a bill...] Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?
[picks up and carries a box] You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch.
...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!
[Cartman's mouth opens in disbelief, then he gets angry] Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit! [throws the box down on the floor, breaking it and spilling its contents. Now there are thirty-two aborted fetuses]
Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?
[rips out a bill...] Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?
[picks up and carries a box] You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch.
...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!
[Cartman's mouth opens in disbelief, then he gets angry] Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit! [throws the box down on the floor, breaking it and spilling its contents. Now there are thirty-two aborted fetuses]
Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.:[later. There are now thirty-one]
Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil.
[shifts in his chair] Buh, alright. [Liane leaves] eh, Butters?
Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?
[leaving his chair and heading for his door] Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.
[turns around] Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.
What is this, a PTA meeting? [before him stand his mother, Sheila, Kyle, and Stan. Stan's head hangs forward as he looks down]
[shock and distress flashes across his face] In the ...hospital? Why?
[more worried] Die? Kenny?
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat. [turns and goes up the stairs]
We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.
Heh, sorry. [Stan remains speechless. Kenny looks at his friends and coughs violently]
[with emotion in his voice] ...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know.
Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay! [walks towards the door. The nurse leaves, then Cartman exits]
[composes himself] Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy? [sniffles]
' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh. [breaks down again, but tries to hide it] Oh man.
I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure.
Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work?
Not at all, but go on. [they both turn and approach a table. On the table is a cage with a rat inside it.]
My God...
So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.
Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!
Hmmm.
Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind. [turns around and heads for the exit]
There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves.
Oh, doctor. [Larry turns around. Cartman has his thumb up] Thanks. Thanks. [Larry returns the gesture with his own thumb up, and Cartman leaves again.]
Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind. [walks away]
My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds. [a shot of Congress] I love Kenny McCormick and... [sob] I want you to love him too. [cries as Congresspeople look to each other] And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song [takes a deep breath]
And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs.
Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.
[hands the clipboard over for her to sign the release form] Great, just sign right here, please. [another woman arrives] Hi. Havin' an abortion today? [Jill hands him the clipboard back, then heads for the clinic] Great. [to the second woman] Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there. [she nods and reaches for the clipboard.] And you sign right here. [hands her the clipboard and she signs. A couple passes by] Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus? [the second woman enters the clinic]
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life.
Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance.
You guys! Come quick! [Stan and Kyle look surprised]
It's... [Cartman turns around] Why, it's a miracle, you guys! [rushes out the door to a spot on the side of the road. Stan and Kyle follow.]
Look. [across the street stands a Shakey's Pizza] I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's! [oozing sounds are heard as a new Shakey's is indeed rising up next to the current one] It worked! [Kyle is shocked.]
Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's!
I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies, [Kyle turns and faces him angrily] and I can finish up the kitchen.
Aah! Kyle! [Kyle punches him across the face a few times] Kyle! [Kyle delivers a series of punches to the chest]
Huho!
We sure are.
[dialing] Shu- shut up you guys, shut up you guys. [the boys quiet down and cover their mouths as the call goes through to City Wok, a Chinese restaurant.]
[the boys giggle] Hello, is this City Wok?
[the boys giggle harder] Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef.
[hops off and follows Stan and Kyle] Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny.
That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.
A- AIDS?
Oh-my-god! [turns around] You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.
Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.
[softly] That's right Stan. [bolder] It's a cash cow, I tell you.
Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.
Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?
I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!
That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.
Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!
He used to be fat but not no more [Butters brightens up]
[slowing] and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.
Uuuh, school project.
Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!
So how long until we can joke about it?
Wugh, that's a long time to wait.
Then eat your puke.
Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it. [Butters looks at Cartman, then at his puke. Reluctantly he scoops it up and eats it.]
Get a hold of yourself, man!
Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.
[pointing to Butters] The fat one!
Just like Jared.
Sir, we are in business!
[heard from the outside] Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again! [the camera goes inside. People are exercising on all sorts of equipment. A woman runs by on a track on the second floor. Butters is pulling at a rowing machine as Cartman spots him. Cartman is eating Cheesy Poofs and barking orders] You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!
[normal] Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.
[barking] Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!
[steps in between them] Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.
Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several.
I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.
Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.
Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!
No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!
Check.
That should blah [babbles a bit] ah- here. [cuts into Butters' abdomen]
Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!
Alrighty.
Alright, I think it's in. [turns around]
[spits out the hose as soon as the fat hits his lips] Bohogh, egh. [puts the hose into the pail for the fat to collect]
There it goes.
[wipes away a bit of fat remaining on his lips] Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.
[looks at the fat flowing out] Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good.
Oh, whoa. Whoa! [the fat rushes out so quickly the tube begins to buck, splattering fat and blood all over the place]
Oh, crap!
Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!
Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was? [whispers] God. [normally] He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever.
Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.
[begins sounding something like Butters. Kyle looks on] Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.
Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! [the others leave and he closes the door]
Eh. [makes himself comfortable on the sofa and turns on the TV. He grunts a bit] Eh. Yeah. [the phone rings; he answers] Well hello?
Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uh watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it.
Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad.
Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.
Bring it on, queer bait. [hangs up] Aaaahhhh, yes! [puts his arms behind his head, quite satisfied with himself]
[answering] Hello?
Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom.
Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure.
Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank. [hangs up] Eh. [resumes eating]
[opens the door in anticipation] There you are, Butters!
No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time!
No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!
Here you go. [hands Butters some drawings] I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.
Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. [makes his way to the door]
Butters, it was my pleasure. [pulls out his mittens and opens the door, then puts them on. He heads for the sidewalk humming a late night theme song, then turns around to frame the house with his fingers, then walks away]
Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.
[alerting the other two] Look you guys, Butters is asleep.
Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick? [drops down] When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water, [takes a glass of water and brings it to Butters' hand] and you put their hand in it... [dunks Butters' hand in it]
And then, you pee on it! [drops his pants and pees on Butters' hand] heheh-heheheheheheheh.
[still peeing] Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh.
You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!
So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.
You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?
Shh-shh, here he comes.
[knowingly] Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?!
I don't smell anything. Do you guys? [bursts out laughing. Stan and Kyle just look at him as Butters looks up, wondering...]
Yeah, well, that's why they call it Asspen. [laughs at his cleverness. A skier skis up to them]
[to Stan] His name is Thumper?
Ugh, no more., [Kyle skis on. Stan is skiing as well, and another skier comes up to him, showering him with snow]
Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. [the music is stopped and a voice is heard]
That's awesome, Kenny. ["Kenny" removes his hood, and it's Butters]
Aww, sick dude!
Oh YES!! [gets off the sofa and heads for the phone]
Shhh. Be quite, you guys! [talks to someone on the phone] Hello, is this Maury Povich? [beat] Oh, well who the hell are you? [beat] Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks? [Stan grins, Kyle stifles a laugh] Ye-right, people with disabilities? [beat] Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show. [beat] Great! [beat] Hih-his condition? [beat] Uh, he has a condition called "chinballalitis." [beat] Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin. [Stan stilfes a laugh and closes his eyes, then Butters stifles a laugh. All of them giggle. Cartman tells the others] Shut uh- shut up you guys. [beat, then on the phone] Yes. [beat] Yes, of course he's very upset about it. [beat] Yes, he cries all the time. [beat] Miserable, uh huh. [beat] You wha- Really?
Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!
Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show. [trying to be subtle] There will of course be a prize involved? [beat] Great. I'll call you back in an hour. [gladly] No, thank you. [hangs up] YES!
[hops off the chair] Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crazy masks and special effects for their dumb movies.
Yeah.
Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend.
Yeah.
Nice.
They look great on you, Butters. They really do.
Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls. [the Trekkers begin to fight over the tape. Butters checks his new balls self-consciously]
Okay, here's your ticket [hands it to Butters] and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. [pushes him forward]
God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?
Buh-ters! Buh-ters!
Testicles and scrotum! [laughs gleefully]
Uh oh, we're losin' him.
Oh, that was close.
The present.
Did he say "the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world"?
Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!
Hello, is this the Maury Povich show? [beat] Yes, I'm calling because I saw your television program, and I also have balls hanging from my chin. [strokes his "balls"] I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world?
What's the new topic?
Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!
Uh, sure!
Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and potpourri, and queazies.
[stunned] ...my, my mom?
Mmoooomm?
Could you do me a favor?
Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt golf course in the wwoooorrlldd?
I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?
Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother.
Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother. [turns around and walks out] Such a beautiful mother.
Jeez, that girl is pissed off.
[under his breath] But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize. [leaves the room and finds the stagehand] Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?
Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt! [brings out a lollipop] I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
Wha'evah! Wha'evah! [walks up to a seat next to his mom's and sits there] Maury, my mom can't control me, I'm tough! Go on, aks hurh!
[under his breath] Mom, we're pretending, remember? Sex and drugs.
[hops off his chair and tries the audience] What-evah! What-evah! [snaps his left-hand fingers back and forth] I'll do what I waunt!
Oh yeah?! I roam with twelve gangs! And we only commit hate crimes! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt! [sits back down]
What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt!
I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!
[hops off his chair and steps forward] Whatevah! I'll crap in Maury's pants! [more audience members leave]
Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time! [rips the balls off Butters' chin. The freaks react immediately and fall silent]
Aaahh! [three freaks trail behind with a boiling pot of water]
They look so delicious. [Kyle looks at him]
[raises his arm up with glee] Memememee!
Oh, man, look at that one! [moves towards the calves] It looks delicious.
Mm, succulent and juicy. [reaches the calf he was eyeing] Can we have a free sample of these, too?
Alriiight!
[responding to a dream] No, Uncle Jesse, no!
[wakes up and sees his friends] What? What the hell are you guys doing??
Where are we going?
What? Why?
So?
Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me "fatass," "butthole," and "douchebag." I really don't feel like you guys's friend. [lies back down and closes his eyes]
[sits up] Oho! So you need me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset!
Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. [turns his ass to Kyle, lowers his pants and underwear, and waits]
Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.
Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss. [softly] Kiss it.
Kiss it. Come on. [gruffly] Kiss it.
No, it has to be Kyle. [turns away. Kyle resists for a few moments, then slowly moves his face towards Cartman's ass through the window. Kyle finally reaches the ass and Cartman unleashes a juicy fart. Kyle withdraws in fits and starts]
[laughs uproariously] Oh man, that was soho awesome!
Hell, I'm not goin' with you! [lies back down and closes his eyes again]
Heeeey! [rolls off the bed and the wrestling continues]
[heaves and takes the torch from Stan] Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask [hands it to Stan] and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. [opens the gas valve and lights the gas stream. A blue flame shoots out and the other boys jump back.]
[peers down. Butters and Kyle join him] You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.
Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.
O! At least I have an ass, Jew!
See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.
I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.
Eh! [follows]
Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling. [pushes the calf further across the ice]
Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.
I want out.
Yeah! Wait-what?
[weakening] Oh, God-damnit you guys.
We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!
Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.
Can't go on. Need... food...
There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf.
All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. [points]
Food!
Look you guys! Beef jerky!
Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.
Go ahead, that's more for us. [tempts the calf next to him with some beef jerky] You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry? [the calf starts chewing on it] Who's the hungry man?
Hippies!
What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!
[walks up to Stan and takes over] Dah, give me that! [takes the receiver from Stan] Talk to me Mike.
Sure, sure.
What do you have in mind?
Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.
All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -
[clears his throat] We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.
Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.
[answers the ringing phone] Hello.
All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf. [in the background, Kyle takes out the guns, tossing them to Butters]
Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! [Butters assembles a machine gun while Kyle inspects a sword. Stan lies by a corner in a fetal position, on a calf, with more lesions appearing on his face]
We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here! [Butters plays soldier in the background, moving his gun around and then saluting while Kyle practices some lunges]
Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else! [Kyle tosses a dud grenade at Butters, who hits it with a spear. The grenade flies off the bed and onto the floor. Kyle and Butters jump with joy]
Mike, speak.
We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?
Good, good.
Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike.
And Worf?
Step back! Tell those men to step back!
[heads for the street] Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies! [approaches the semi-truck, where Michael Dorn now sits at the wheel. He gets into the passenger side and sits] Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, and you must refer to me as "Captain."
No. See, you must say, "Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?"
You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.
[correcting Dorn] "Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!"
[calls out] Okay, all set!
Step on it, Mr. Worf! [the semi peels off]
Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!
[correcting gently] "Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?"
Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.
[looks out] Oh, it's a double-cross!!
What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!
Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!
Thank God we stopped it in time.
All right!
Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?
I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!
Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name? [points to Stan]
Stan, okay. What's your name? [points to Kyle]
Kyle. What's your name? [looks at Butters]
Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.
Amen.
What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated. [takes a hold of the remote]
[leaves the sofa] Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. [heads for the television]
Dude, do you wanna see the Terrance & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? [moves the cable, and the vertical goes out of whack]
Okay, how about ... that? [moves it again, and the cathode ray tube pops. The wall behind the TV is blackened, and Cartman slowly peeks]
[panicked] It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole!
I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.
[gruffly] Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously!
[arrives breathless] Huh. Ohmigod! Huh.
God, when is this gonna get to the commercials? [Gerald arrives with Ike]
Argh!
We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.
[trailing again] Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih!
There, you got it, you got it!
Oh, thank God.
We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer for the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials.
This TV is great, Chef.
Aagh! God-dammit!
[blubbering] This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that.
Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar.
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!
Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! [once the boys are in place, Stan walks over to the TV and turns it on. "Puppies From Around The World" comes on, and Stan quickly changes the channel to the Russell Crowe show]
Here we go!
That's it? That's all the commercials?
Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now!
Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people!
Eewww!
God, I hate old people!
And my house is being fumigated!
[trailing the other three] Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me! [stops] Oh! I lost a doughnut! [turns around and heads back] Oooh! Oh oh! [stops] Oh my God! [turns around and tries to catch up with the others] Leave no doughnut behind!
[glares at Butters and slowly gets angry] Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!
The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! [Stan is the first to reach the remote control, so he takes it and turn on the TV]
These commercials are all so God-damn stupid!
You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.
[tosses his popcorn into the air] Woohoo!!! [the popcrn showers all the boys as they begin to move around happily]
[on the phone] Clyde, Clyde? Did you see it? [Stan jumps up on the sofa alongside Cartman] Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.
You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to see.
Yeah, it sure does!
I'll do it.
Butters, could you take a seat, please?
Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.
Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and "filled the gap," so to speak. [wiggles the index and middle fingers of each hand as a quote gesture]
Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.
I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...
Lame, yes.
Yes, well, we weren't.
[shakes Butters' left hand] But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by. [points to the door] You know the way out, right? [Butters look at the other two boys, who each returns a somber look. He gets off the chair, looks once more, then walks away dejectedly]
Who cares?
[takes the mic] All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout. [camera pans across the seated kids, then back to Cartman] Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?
Clyde... [mouths something]... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.
[on a blue sofa] I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. [cut to Jimmy entertaining Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Dougie, Clyde, and Craig]
...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. [takes a sip of ZOOP soda]
We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride. [cut to the log ride] The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line. [the boys are escorted to the first car, cut back to Cartman] That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...
[the boys look at Jimmy] Oh, really? [turns to his note pad] That's gonna cost some points. [writes down some numbers as Jimmy is helped into the log.]
All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten. [Kyle goes off to get the box of roses] If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out. [Kyle returns with the roses and sets them down] Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?
Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?
All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! [the others moan and leave their seats]
Next?
Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.
Alrighty then. [the boys take their seats]
Uh, what's the question again?
Five times one is of course...
Five. [the door opens and Professor Chaos appears]
Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!
[escorts Craig away] Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. [Craig leaves]
All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?
Just one more rose, Kyle.
All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out! [Craig, Clyde, Jason, and Luigi leave]
Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, "get the fudge out!" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!
[a shot of him on a sofa] The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates. [a shot of the three boys making comments during judging. Cartman takes notes]
Next please.
If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?
Very nice. [takes notes]
You don't drink tea at a baseball game, you French piece of crap!
All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! [Pip leaves his seat and Token comes in]
Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?
I think Towelie is awesome.
Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.
Token's a smartass.
Yeah. Do we really need another one?
[disgusted] Oh, thanks Jimmy.
Alright Jimmy, see ya. [the door closes]
Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. [the camera pans across the audience, showing the candidates close-up]
Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? [another shot of the candidates]
[off screen. Stan and Kyle look] You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! [excited, he rushes up and stands between then, holding an ad]
Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!
No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!
Look! [the boys draw close. The ad is shown] Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff.
Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.
[shows irritation] Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on. [turns to Stan and Tweek and continues excitedly] Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!
If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!
Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow... [bubbles appear as Cartman dreams] Yesss... Yeesss...
[shown floating down to the briny deep. Two pairs of sea arms catch him. The sea couple rights him and walk with him in the middle]
Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people. [closes his eyes and turns to his left side] Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. [goes to sleep]
Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says [slowing down to read] "Step 2. [grabs a small sack] Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly." [smiles, then remembers something. He turns to face the other boys] Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?
[turns to the tank] Hold the sign up, Kyle! [Kyle picks a sign up off the floor and holds it to his chest] Higher, Kyle! [Kyle raises it higher, in front of his face] Okay. [opens the egg sack and whispers] Here we go. [pours the eggs into the tank and taps the bag for good measure. Kyle moves the sign a bit so he could peek. Cartman grins again in anticipation, but it fades. Kyle lowers the sign to his chest. Cartman looks from various angles, then takes out the magnifying glass for a closer look. Two pale shrimp crawl around in the tank. Kyle drops the sign]
What the fuck is this?! [Stan approaches and looks in the tank]
I got RIPPED OFF! [pounds the desk and sets the box on the floor to his left]
[approaches Kyle and confronts him] Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!! [moves on to Tweek] And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!! [his rant ended, he walks across the room] They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep.
[at the window] Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!
[brightly] Heheh, okay, okay.
Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!
[rushes to Tweek and covers his mouth] Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!
Tweek! Where are you going?
In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.
We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.
Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.
[whispers] Ugh. [then] Just remember the song "Can't Touch This" and you'll remember the code word!
Is it her?
Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach! [the boys look at him, shocked] Oh, God! You guys are such pussies! [starts digging around in the belly] Hemmm...
No, just a bunch of goo.
There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know. [looks at his hands] The blood is washed neatly from our hands. [the door opens and Chef enters with a bunch of stuff.]
[stopping Chef] It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium!
Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too.
G'night, guys.
[settling in] Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. [dozes off. The camera moves to the tank to look at the tank.]
[rushes up] H'you guys! Come quick! [turns and runs off] You won't believe it!
Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! [the other three approach the tank. Cartman picks up the magnifying glass for a closer look]
I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics. [brings out a small chalkboard with an equation written on it and points to the various parts of the equation] Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety.
That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them thrive. Tweek!
You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to put them all in.
Me? [camera closes in on him] I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.
Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?
Do you have them or not?
What's your name?
Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? [she looks at him and rises, moving off to her left.]
[inspecting the vial] I see, very interesting. [pulls the cap off and pours the semen onto his left hand]
Takin' a look here. [pulls out a portable microscope and inspects the semen between his left thumb and index finger. He stretches and squishes the semen. Frances looks on puzzled] Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.
No, gallons.
Dammit! Give me all you've got, then! [the seminal fluid slides down on his fingers]
[entering] That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?
And I've got the sea men. [raises a bowl of semen up to the tank and begins scooping the fluid into the tank.]
Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.
Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh. [scoops out the last of the semen] There we go. [drops the empty bowl]
Nothin' to do now but wait.[the boys huddle around the new, larger tank.]
Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.
Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years. [grabs his magnifier and looks at the society. It now looks Roman. He begins to speak in wonder] Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-? [spots a statue. It's one of him. Hundreds of sea people worship it] Oh. They think I'm God. [throws the magnifier away and rejoices] Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?! [runs to his window, throws the doors open and screams out] I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!! [his mom opens the door and takes some trash to the trash can next to the driveway] Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!
[arrives, shown as Nelson] Ha ha! [Butters is just stunned.]
Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.
Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.
I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.
What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?
[everyone is silent for a few seconds, then] ...So?
Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?
Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.
That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people! [small explosions are seen and the tank jumps]
Yeah! Go! [two more explosions are seen]
Oh God-damnit! [two missiles, one from behind each statue, fly towards the surface and back down towards their respective targets. The impacts both missiles create tear the tank apart and the sea people flood out of the tank. Screams are heard as they fall to the ground. Cartman is stunned, he looks and falls on his knees.] Oh no! Oh the humanity!
Why can't societies just live in peace?
I don't know.
Ih... in our... butt?
[thinking] Maybe... No.
Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?
Hm.
Aw, dude, I think I might have it.
[gets up and starts pacing] It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?
Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth. [long pause] Hm?
What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.
Have you ever tried it?
I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!
Okay, let's go, Jew! [Cartman rushes off and Kyle follow. Stan and Tweek remain seated on the curb.]
[turns to look at Kyle] Hold on! [turns back to the task at hand] God, let a man crap!
I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!
[looking at the boys] I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around.
Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?! [the other boys fix their gaze at him] Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously. [tries again. A few spasms later and a big log of crap comes out his mouth and into the toilet. All the boys are stunned, even Cartman.]
[excited] Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth! [starts chanting] I crapped out my mo-outh! [walks over to Kyle] You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!
Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. [puts his hands behind his back oh so modestly]
It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars! [Kyle gets upset] I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- [Kyle shuts the door on him, looks, then turns around and walks away from the door. Cartman pops up outside a window waving the bill at him. Kyle turns, goes to the window, and lowers the blinds, then walks off]
[arriving] You guys! You guys! Look! [he's dressed in a bathrobe, swim trunks, and sandals]
I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.
So? So now I can do this! [takes off his robe, throws the bills in the air, and rolls around in the floating bills.] Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!
[luxuriating in the bills] Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.
Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.
[with a solid retort] That's stupid and immature, Cartman!
[rushes up] You guys, you guys! [drags a small inflatable wading pool behind him] I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters!
So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long! [picks up the bag of quarters and prepares to pour them in] Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. [the quarters start pouring in, and Cartman gloats]
O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?
Heh... [the smile vanishes] what?
[taking time to figure out what that means...] You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!! [kicks the pool and it deflates. He walks away angry. Stan and Kyle grin at each other - they planned this change in tactics. The parents arrive cheering and hollering]
Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.
[they reach the ticket booth] Yeah, we want our money back!
You asshole! [turns around and catches up with the other boys]
Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.
Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!
Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!
Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!
Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. [takes the marker and adds the words "FRee HAT" at the very end.]
Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.
Well we can just make them out of paper.
It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!
[enormous face appearing over the clouds] Tweek! [brushes the clouds away with his hands] TWEEK!! [Tweek opens his eyes] TWEEK!!
How many hats have you made?
We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow! [slaps him hard across the back.] Get the lead out!
They're gonna kick your ass, Tweek!
["Free hat! Free hat! Free hat! Free hat!"] I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.
[takes the mic] Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them.
But just remember that I do all the talking.
Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.
Just now - [quickly, counting off with his left hand] 1 2 3 dibs! [punches his right palm with his left fist]
What could possibly go wrong?
[blinks and looks at the camera for a long time] ...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. [the camera moves from Cartman to Tweek]
[to Stan] Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. [resumes gawking at the two]
Yeah, we're children.
Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.
Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?
Thank you. [turns a page up and over. A schematic of George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch is shown] Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.
He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?
[rushes up to stop Tweek] Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well.
People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?
[draws near] Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! [walks off]
Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!
Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!
Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.
[beat] You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? [the boys reach for the left side of their bodies and rip off their clothes. Underneath they wear colorful Latin outfits and grin.]
Hit it, Tweek! [Tweek goes over to a boombox and presses the play button, then returns to the group. Caribbean music plays] In the tropical isles with the coconut trees, there's a lots of-
...No, he has an icy heart.
It's a cool island song.
Oh, do we wanna do that?
Wow.
AY!
Man, that new version must have sucked balls.
That and youth. Those guys are old.
[strokes the lamb and sets it aside] Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious. [grabs a basket with a bottle of lotion sitting inside and lowers it down the hole. The basket stops when it reaches Polly Prissy Pants, which sits at the bottom of the hole] Now it takes the lotion from the basket.
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.
It puts the lotion back in the basket!
[throws a fit] Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket!
Yes, mom?
[thinks a bit, then looks up] ...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?
[pause] Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.
[starts to throw another fit] But I wanna plaaayyy.
Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?
Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?
It just... It just seems like a really awesome shirt.
Yeah, may be.
Right, heh.
Woohoo.
God, you know what? That's so true. Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.
Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! [the boys crack up]
Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk.
[offers Tweek his plate] Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met.
And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.
And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.
Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.
And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you and some peanuts. [presents the watch and peanuts]
And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.
Pleeeeease???
[removes the watch and peanuts] Alright, fine! So then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that it's been really fun. Here's a watch and some peanuts. [presents the watch and peanuts again]
Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?
[arrives] That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan! [leaves, then returns] Fuck you, Tweek! [leaves, then returns] Bebe, you're still cool. [leaves again]
[holds up the poodle] See, and this is Precious.
[squeezes the poodle] Bark bark bark. [sets the poodle aside] Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket [puts the lotion in the basket] and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. [the basket descends]
Now you say, "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again."
Heheh, yeah.
Now say it again, louder.
Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!
Now, just yell "Put the lotion in the fucking basket!"
Put the lotion in the fucking basket! [pushes the rubber poodle into the hole] Oh no! Precious!
Now you say, "Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!"
You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- [stops when he hears Timmy's wheelchair and looks around]
We're playing "Lambs."
Bebe's boobs?
So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?
What a stupid bitch! [the boys start laughing again. Butters is laughing hard, but realizes that his finger is still on Wendy's breast.]
[orders his ticket first] One please.
Dude, relax.
Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?
So weak. So weak, dude. Man.
At least I'm not a stupid Jew.
Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.
You bet your fat clown ass it is!
[the boys' jaws drop a bit] ...ticket stub?
Wu-we don't really "need" the ticket stub, do we?
[drops the buckets] GODDAMMIT!!!
You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. [Zoom in on Cartman, who starts remembering...]
[takes it, then hands it to Kyle] Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.
[bolts away] Kenny!!!
Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!
[muffled] What the fuck is closure?!
You turned him into a teapot?
Wewewewewewe...
Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards. [resumes the detection] Wewewewewewe...
...Kenny? [the boys lose their fear and rise up to look at the urn] Kenny?!
What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!
God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!
Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!
Hmmm. [leaves his stool and returns with some milk, a glass, and a spoon. He scoops up some ashes and drops them into the glass. He pours the milk onto the ashes, stirs them up, and drinks the milk ] Hmm, not bad. [scoops some more ashes into the milk]
[sits up, eyes wide open] Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. [growls a bit, turns to sleep, and farts. The door flies open and Stan and Kyle rush in]
[sits up again] What what? [sees who it is] Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!
How?
I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car. [hands it to the other two boys, who put it in place]
...No. [the boys let the seat drop] Ey! Euuugh.
[startled] Wha-uh, what?? What?
I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.
Do you think?
Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.
[joins the other two boys, grunting as he gets into position] Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!
Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.
Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.
You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.
Because Jews don't believe in heaven!
Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.
AH! [stunned, he has another flashback. A heartbeat is heard]
In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto
What did you say?!
What did you say?!
[in the present] I said "Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!" [opens his eyes and looks around] Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?
I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.
[amid his thoughts] You're a- stupid Jew.
[resigned, comes clean] Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.
[knowingly] Shut up!
[knowingly] Shut up!
That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.
I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.
Looks like I've come to the right place.
Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that I need sucked out, please.
Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! [a woman and her boyfriend enter the clinic. The woman sobs]
Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me! [the woman can't believe what she's hearing] I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!
Eh! [becomes catatonic once more, and another flashback comes]
Kenny! Kenny! Kenny...
[takes it, then hands it to Kyle] Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle...
You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts! [fast forward to Kenny's room. He walks to a locked box by the window while looking at the ticket stub. He unlocks it, puts the ticket in, and locks the box again.]
The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere! [walks up to a couple filling out paperwork] Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God! [heads out the door] You guys! YOU GUYS!!
You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! [Stan and Kyle rise and line up on either side of Cartman]
I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere.
I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic [Kyle looks down at the lumber, then looks at the pile behind him] and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box. [Kyle fishes around for a small solid piece of lumber, then finds one and aims it at Cartman's head] I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken- [thunk] AY! [is dazed for a bit, then recovers none too pleased, then glares at Kyle]
Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! [starts at Kyle, but Stan holds him back]
Not by giving me brain damage!
[stares at Stan, then resigns to his former position] Alright, go ahead. [Kyle rears back and swings... thunk] AY!... no. [Kyle rears back and swings... thunk] AY!...
...I've never heard the words "only" and "candy" in the same sentence before.
[chuckles] No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick! [looks stunned] ...Oh Jesus Christ.
Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! [runs off]
Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!
It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. [a car passes by and Cartman fires away at it with his staff]
And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew.
Jews can't be Paladins.
Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?
Man, that's crap.
And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.
Prepare for battle! [switch to the car]
This sounds like a really important quest.
This... is so cool.
Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. [the boys head up the stairs and out of the house. Butters opens the door and jumps at them]
And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. [three older boys ride up on their bikes and stop before the group. It's the sixth graders]
You're gay!
Yeah!
The one tape must be returned! [swats the tape out of the sixth grader's hands with the staff and watches as the tape falls into Stan's hands] Run! [the boys run away from the sixth graders]
I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.
[rises and moves off] Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.
[waves his left hand around] Open. [nothing. He waves his left hand again] Bellog. [the door opens and Clyde appears]
We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.
Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.
Clyde's a dick.
Kevin, god-damnit..! [Kevin looks around, then hops off his chair and leaves]
Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. [the other boys stir]
My God, this thing must really be powerful. [the boys turn to look at the tape]
Quiet!
You're acting like a bunch of assholes!
Yeah, stupid. [higher pitch] Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's big enough for the both of us. [a bit lower] Shut up, Kenny.
A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!
Yes, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure! [they pass a yard on which some kids are playing] For that is the way of the--
[after a few moments of thought] Ha!! Fags! [the boys move on. They soon pass a Country Café]
It's Butters.
Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. [behind the six boys, at some distance, is Butters, skulking along in the shadows]
Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.
There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! [the sound of sixth graders is heard in the distance. The boys look around to find the direction of the sound. The sixth graders appear in the horizon behind them and ride in quickly, screaming all the while]
Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!
I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!
Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!
We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are! [twitched] That's what "lost" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!
If that was possible.
We're screwed.
The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.
And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
[leans towards Craig, who pays attention] Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a... [glances back] Pakistani.
[begins making a paper plane involuntarily] No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?
[finishes the plane and aims it at Mr. Garrison] Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! [fires the plane off. It hits the board and falls away]
No, it was Kenny!
Ey!
Aw man, this is awesome! ["JAP"]
[excited, runs up to the guide] I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!
[over at a fourth exhibit, a man cowering over a bag of money] Look, a covetous Jew!
Ey!
[strokes his chin and tries something out] I'm not fat, I have a different life choice.
Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! [the adults chuckle]
I'll take three lunches today, please.
It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC. [Chef is puzzled]
Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work.
Nothing.
[salutes] Yes sir! [the guard walks away] Phew. [opens the door and steps inside, laughing. A few moments later he craps and starts laughing]
[exits and alerts any available soldier] Hey, I was just kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! [goes to find a soldier]
[disoriented] Kenny. Shut up, Kenny.
Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!
[cheerfully] Hey you guys! How's it goin'?
[surly] What the hell are you assholes doing here?!
Oh, about a month.
He's gone again.
[giggles] Ha-heheheh. [the boys look at him; he takes his headphones off and looks at them] That was Kenny laughing, not me.
Kenny!
Thanks, asshole.
Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!
Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!
Oh, good. [All passengers put on their headsets.]
Oh for the love of Christ. [switches from miffed to excited] I wanna watch, fat boy! [...and back to miffed] No, Kenny, it's not funny!
Right now?
Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.
Ahh, Aahhhh! [the adults back away from the bed. Soon, an orange glow appears on Cartman's belly]
[entering refreshed] Hey, ah I feel a lot better.
God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!
It's still at baggage claim!
[takes the bag from Kyle and offers it to Stan] Then you throw it away, smartass. [Stan walked into that one]
Who's this asshole?
Then how does he know our names?
Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?
That is so awesome!! Thank you God! [bows deeply] Oh praise God!
[pats Stan on the back] Juvi Hall! [laughs heartily, then gloats] Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser! [laughs heartily]
[an egg-shaped chair is seen, with its back to the boys] Yes, come in, please. [the chair turns around, and Cartman appears seated on it.]
Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys.
I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?
Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then? [Stan and Butters stop in their tracks] Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?
That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since.
Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. [Stan and Butters think a moment, then take seats before Cartman]
[lets out a heavy sigh] God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?
Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way.
Eighteen thousand dollars. [Butters looks to Stan for guidance] How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five. [Stan still looks angry, Butters follows] How about five bucks?
Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here. [displays a few brochures and opens one] What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.
Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. [displays some swatches with poop samples on them]
Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.
Now, personally, I like the baby green. [switches to a new swatch] But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.
Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.
Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.
Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.
The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.
Your parents will drive all the way out to the school discovering that no meeting is actually taking place.
And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. [Stan's excitement vanishes]
What?
Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.
Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations. [throws the brochure away and gets some paper from inside the desk] Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog.
Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?
[sighs] Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?
I am a professional, suh! [watches Stan leave] Don't worry, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied.
Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe! [a painter descends from the small ladder he's on] The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!
¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba!
Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú? [looks in another part of the living room] ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we [sees a sponge on the floor and picks it up] spackle with the sponge. [dips the sponge into a poop tray and spackles the wall with it] See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.
Marrado. Spectacularrr.
God, it's so hard to find good help. [runs into Butters, who has just entered the house] Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?
Yearh, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.
Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I? [notices another worker] ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!
Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off.
Ooo, ah, that's a different company. [the doorbell rings] Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ­¡Vamonos!
Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.
Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become.
Who the hell are you?
[sets the box of cookies down] Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful!
Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want! [The Marshes leave. He joins them] Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!
You're done?
Yeah, so how's it look?
But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?
What?!
Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? [lifts up a sheet from the desk]
It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.
[lunges at Kyle Schwartz and grabs him by the left arm] God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!
Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!
[thinks a minute] Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!
Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?
Jesus Christ!
[walks up to Stan and Kyle, who are holding candy canes] Hi guys! ["Christmas Tree!" Cartman is feeling quite cheerful. He hugs both Stan and Kyle] A very Merry Christmas to you. God bless us, everyone! [he lets go]
I'm just letting you guys know how special you are to me.
Oh my God, that's it!
Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunates! Follow me! [leaves in high spirits, then returns] You guys, come on! Right now! [Stan and Kyle shrug, then follow Cartman.]
[breathlessly, comes out with the box and sets it down near the driveway] ...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore. [rushes back inside] And here! Here's some Christmas cookies! [comes out with the box of cookies and sets it down] And some holly and mistletoe! [rushes in to get it, then comes out with the box, setting it next to the box of toys] Oh, this'll be the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too.
They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them.
[annoyed, softly] Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo. [in normal voice] Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you!
The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.
Really?
Wow!
[grabs the box of holly and mistletoe and heads for the train] Get the rest of the stuff you guys!
You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunates! [moves on] Now come on!
Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!
Wow, is that where Santa lives?
Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?
[brushes it off] Oh, that's so lame of them. [Stan looks at him]
[with hands behind his back] Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.
That's what I thought.
Hooray!
No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.
Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!
[blubbering] Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!
It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.
Oh, Christ.
Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!
Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-
Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh!
I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-
[looks at Kyle, then lowers his eyelids a bit] I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.
[draws close to Kyle] Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!
[resumes his position in back of the sleigh and speeds up his song] It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...
Jesus!
This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole! [Jesus looks over, Cartman notices] I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people.
This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys.
Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-
Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means.
Oh, God-damnit!
Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again! [kicks the toy away. The camera zooms out enough for a fourth person to walk into the shot]
What?
Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!
Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead! [the boys laugh, Kyle picks up Ike and swings him towards Cartman. Ike smacks Cartman in the face and Cartman falls on his back] Ow!
[gets up and yawns] Uuugh.
That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed… [the dream sequence begins] in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room [his window flies open and a bright beam blinds him as he rises to see what it is]. Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open [a glow appears around the door as an alien peeks inside] and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway. [This hallway has specimens on either side of it. "Weeaak!"] Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me. [four aliens hover over him and lower his pajama pants as a robot arm nearby gets to work on his ass] And they had big heads and big black eyes…
What?
No, it was just a dream, [crosses his arms] my mom said so.
What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?
Eh... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.
No I don't remember that!
No, because the aliens erased my memory!
Aw dude, I hate repeats!
[whips an angry look at him] SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! [pulls his head back and rests it on his left hand]
What?
[displeased] Haha, very funny.
Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Oww.
Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.
[with a dreamy, relieved look] Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome! [smiles]
[the probe collapses and sinks back into his ass] Aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh!
You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I"M NOT ALL RIGHT!!
[crosses his arms] Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. [grins]
Nope! It has to be Kyle!
[lowers his pants and moons Kyle] Come, Kyle. Do hurry. [Kyle moves tentatively toward Cartman and bares his left arm] Go ahead, it won't bite. [Kyle raises his arm and move in. Cartman farts and Kyle angrily lowers his arm. Cartman and Kenny laugh]
[laughing] I couldn't resist. I'm sorry. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kenny joins in. and Kyle angrily lowers his arm.]
[laughing] Okay. Okay okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kenny joins in. and Kyle angrily lowers his arm.]
[laughing] Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm, looking at the other guys.] Gahaaa! Derrr!
Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Oh yes it is! [swats the odor towards Kyle.]
Okay, okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Ohh, double psych!
All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.
No, go ahead. I'm dry.
But it was one of the best times I've ever had.
Okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Ohhh! God-dammit! [Cartman, Kenny, and Chef laugh]
This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.
Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.
[steps forward and points to Jeff] It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!
What are you doing, man?! [Chef drives towards the barricade and goes up a wooden ramp, into the air.]
When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.
Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass! [panics] Oh God, help me you guys!
[looks down] ...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord.
This is like my fifth time. [the room brightens and two doors open at the other end of the room. The boys turn and face it]
Aw God, that movie pissed me off.
Santa!
[impressed] Oooo, very nice.
How about a taco, that craps ice cream? [the alien transforms into the taco. A wad of ice cream falls out of him] Guys?
Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth! [the boys just look at each other]
[miffed at the link, rests his head on his left hand] Tell us about it!
No.
There's even World War Three to look forward to.
[yawns] Uuugh.
That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
What is it, Chef?
We didn't go to your comedy show.
Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.
[jumps up and catches up to them] Hey, wait a minute! [Timmy and Jimmy stop] You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!
Can too!
Oh God-damnit!!
But they say I can't be in their club!!
[laughing] Put more clay on the balls.
[retorts] What a crime. [the three others chuckle, then laugh out loud]
You can't do that!
You're an art teacher!
We can't let her get away with this! [voicing dropping to almost a whisper] I think tonight we need to do something drastic.
Like find out where Mrs. Streibel lives, and go over there, and... TP her house.
Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
[sensing Kyle's reluctance] What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken? [begins strutting like a chicken and making chicken noises. Kyle kicks Cartman in the balls in anger] Ugh! [drops to his knees, then gets one leg up]
[in pain] Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!
Should be fine.
Okay. [reaches behind the other boys and grabs something] Here we go, pack of chewing gum. [tosses it into the first cart. They approach the cash register]
Yep. All set.
Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.
Heh yeah, that that's right.
No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.
It's the right address-wait! Look there! [the teacher prepares the dining-room table] There's Mrs. Streibel! This is the place. [loosens the drawstring on his back and lets the sides fall away. In the dining room, a boy and girl arrive and sit at table]
So?
Kyle, you're being an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah. [takes out a roll and advances a bit] Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! [unleashes the first roll]
Come on, let's go! [he and Kenny cross the road and drop down to a ditch on the other side. Stan follows]
Aw man, that was sooo awesome! [smiles]
Who cares??
Me?? [takes a couple steps forward] There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. [Kyle blanches]
Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streibel probably had it comin' to her.
Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caught, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. [the bell rings and Mr. Garrison enters with some books.]
[snaps his fingers] Damn!
Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.
Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.
Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??
[exasperated] Oh, for Christ's sake!
Thank you, Stan. [the doorknow begins to turn] Sh sh, here they come, here they come. [the door opens and Mr. Mackey appears] "And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?
Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй.
They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.
Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!
[in rave tones] Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?
No need. I have one for you right here. [presents a glass of water to him]
Is there anything else I can get for you?
You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. [closes the door]
Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second? [Stan waves bye to Clyde, Craig, and Kevin, and they leave. He and Kenny approach Cartman talks in hushed tones] I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.
Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.
Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
[a few seconds later] Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!
We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.
Why not?
He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. [walks off]
I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?
I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.
Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat? [Kyle walks over and helps Cartman load the block and chain onto the boat. Kyle then hops in. Cartman retrieves a bat, loads it onto the boat, and hops in. The boat begins to float away from the shore.] Okay, let's go. [starts to row. The boat heads for the middle of the pond, and eerie music plays] So how are things, Kyle?
And you feel like you have to confess.
I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. [whacks him again]
Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. [whacks him twice more]
Won't be long, Kyle. [whacks him three more times.]
I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.
They did?
But can I still kill Kyyyle?
Uh, can we see them-him-her?
What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
[rushes up and intervenes] Wiffle ball, anyone? [glares at Kyle] Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?
You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?
What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.
Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.
So... so then, how can you feel bad?
...But he's not gonna get in trouble.
What?? Eh... [tries to be upbeat] hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!
[looks at the other boys in disbelief] For oth-er... [winces] Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?
Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!
Come on, you guys! Hurry! [steps forward and looks back to his friends] Guys, hurry!
It's over this way! Come on!
So how are things, guys?
I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
Can't I? [pulls out the Wiffle ball bat and starts whacking the other three. They just look at each other.]
[steps forward from the back of the room] Hi guys.
I told them everything, you guys. It's over.
My consciences just caught up with me.
I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.
I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.
Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-
Hm.
[searching his notebook] Math homework, Math homework. Where did I file that?
[reading Kenny's sign] Bush is a Naizi
...Eh the... Founding who? [seconds later, both sides rush each other and attack]
[beginning to slack off] Ugh. Ughuh. [tries to resume studying, but his eyes grow heavy. He panics] I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! [yawns loudly and promptly sleeps on his book]
But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.
Maaaa. M-maaaa.
Maaaa. Mah mah mh. [reluctantly returns to reading. He begins to fidget, then reads more, then fidgets again, turns the page, fidgets once more, then just thinks] Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days? [repeats the question, his voice fading at each repetition] In those days? In those days? In those days?
I'm trying to have a flashback.
You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!
No. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second. [thinks] Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then? [repeats the last two words, his voice fading at each repetition] Back then? Back then? Back then? [nothing happens. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look at him] Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me. [his voice begins to fade and he begins moving his hands around like a pantomime. The camera closes in] With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.
[throws a fit] Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!
That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. [tests the tautness of the string]
All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!
Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please? [Stan and Kyle look at each other, Kenny looks at them. They clear the doorway. Kyle stands on one side, Stan and Kenny on the other. Cartman backs up, clears his throat, then begins to walk with purpose] Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. [trips the string. The rock immediately falls on his head, knocking him out. He moans a few times.]
Benjamin Franklin?
[touches Kyle, then in a weak raspy voice] Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!
Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.
Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Founding Fathers!
I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!
Or a really sweet one. [a bell is heard]
Whoa, here it goes! [triggers the sledgehammer as he falls. Both he and the TiVo land in the tub, and the house shorts out. Cartman is electrocuted as he lands in the water. The boys spend a few seconds in the darkness looking at Cartman, wondering if he'll come to. Kenny turns and walks away slowly]
Ohhh awesome!!! [a horse-drawn carriage approaches, driven by a teenage boy.]
Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?
Oho yes! I did it I did it!
Oho kick fucking ass, dude! [approaches the carriage and climbs up to sit alongside the driver]
No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.
Well you know, it's a... [points at something] H-ho, awesome! [they've entered the town and Cartman begins to sing.]
Super neato! [both driver and Cartman disboard and walk towards the door]
But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.
Oh, okay.I guess I understand. [the driver walks off. Cartman notices some firewood and picks up a log of it, then follows the driver while singing to himself]
And I am the official messenger boy, I am.
[beholding it] Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day.
It's a bitch, ain't it?
Wow.
[observing] Whoa, how very very relevant.
Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
Wow, I get it now! I get it! [senses his flashback coming to an end] Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.
Wow!
[appears on stage in his hospital gown, his hair disheveled] Everyone, stop! Please! [everyone stops and looks at him]
If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.
I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to. [a shot of the crowd]
You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called "having your cake and eating it too."
The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.
[approaches the mic with his left hand behind his back] Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.
[shows off his left hand, which is open] Miss Lopez, come on out here. [the hand closes to become a fist, and that fist has a face and hair painted on it]
Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?
Oh, you mean this one? [whips out a doll's dress for the occasion]
[fits the dress under his hand] There we go, Saright?
That's a very pretty dress. [the Latino Endowment Council is shown again]
Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez.
Nono, Jeh-
Jeh-
Jeh
Jennifer Lopez.
Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?
And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. [Much more cheer and applause for him. The school gives him a standing ovation. The members of the Latino Endowment council jump up and down with joy and pride. Stan and Kenny clap with everyone else, Kyle is just stunned.]
Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!
Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.
[walks up to Kyle] Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.
Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?
Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?
Is nice?
Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.
Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.
I agree. Those places are stupid.
Hey, I'm on your guys' side.
Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!
All right all right, here's ten dollars! [takes out the bill and hands it to the cashier]
Yeah, I wanna leave.
What?
Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez. [hands the phone to "her"]
What do they want?
S'awright?
What? What?
[puts the phone to his ear] Hello, are you still there?
You want to sign Ms. Lopez?
Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!! [hangs up and grins] We're gonna be rich!
Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs! [runs off]
There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!
[scoots back to his bedside lamp and turns it off, then settles under the covers] Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. [rubs off her open eyes and paints some closed lids on his hand.]
Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow... [begins to dream of taunting Kyle] Tomorrow...
"Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!" [in class, sitting next to each other] "You were wrong, Kyle!" [in the cafeteria, as Kyle walks by with his lunch] "Nananananaaana!" [on the bus ride home] "Hahahahahaaaha!" [images of Kyle come forth, crying] "Nananananaaana!" "Hahahahahaaaha!" [in his sleep] Awesommme. Yeeessss.
[runs up] Hey everybody! Listen up! I've got something to tell Kyle! [Slience.]
[approaches him] Hahahahahaaaha! Hahahahahaaaha! Hahaha, Hahaha, Hahahahahahaha!
Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to record an album next week.
[a slight gloat arises] Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich. [nods to his hand] And famous.
Jennifer Lopez?
Not me!
I'm sure it was just a mistake.
Shut your God-damned mouth!
Nobody!
Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop!
I will!
Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.
Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez.
What the hell are you doing?
Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep!
Sleep!
[slowly, whiney] Sleep!
Moooommm! [Cartman's mother enters the room]
Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!
[real tired] He-yesss.
[hides his left hand] She's not here right now.
NO!
I'm not going out in his car.
I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework. [Ben stars picking his nose]
I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!
[reacts] NO!
Aw, God dammit! [looks away in disgust once more. Ben begins to give French kisses to "Jennifer Lopez" and the hand responds] Aww- awww, dude!
OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT! [opens his door, hops out, and walks away] WE'RE LEAVING NOW!!
Aww crap.
OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!
I told you this would happen. [Kyle, Stan and Kenny show up.]
Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.
EHAGH! [next to him is Ben Affleck, naked and relaxed] Moooooommmm! [Ben wakes up]
Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!
You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!
What? Oh- AWWW! [wipes his hand off on his pajamas] Ben Affleck's spooge!!
What news?
S'aright.
Oh, balls!
[sad] Guys, I need to talk to you.
I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.
Stop doing what?
Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? [removes the oven mitt and "Jennifer Lopez" emerges coughing]
Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.
Quiet, Ms. Lopez.
Guys... Uh... Uh... [dejected, he turns away and walks out the front door]
I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?
[dances back to the other three boys] Hahahahahaaaha! [into Kyle's face] I got you kinda! I got you kinda!
Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.
Stupid assholes! [turns and follows] How come nobody has a crime to solve?
My God...
What have you got, Marsh?
[puts a hand on Kyle, looks away and closes his eyes] Jesus, we're too late.
Slowly the rage built inside his mind. [Mr. Farnickle is shown in bed, getting angry. Dramatic lighting enhances the mood] "Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!
Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. [the scenario shows Mr. Farnickle walking up behind his wife as she dusts the TV and whacking her three times, killing her and fracturing her skull]
The torso he would dump into the lake. [Mr. Farnickle tosses his wife's torso over the side of his boat, then watches as the torso heads for the lake bottom]
And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.
Looks like the game is over, old man! [the surprised couple looks at them]
Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington.
[waving his mom off] Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all. [Liane goes upstairs. Cartman looks up] And get us some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!
Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.
No sign of forced entry.
We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room.
Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!
Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.
Right. I think I know exactly where to start.
[thinks hard of how to start the interrogation] Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!
Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! [behind him, Stan and Kyle watch from a makeshift booth]
You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!
You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!
Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. [holds out a cup for Butters to take]
You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!
Stop playing games!
That does it! Wait right here! [goes behind the booth and laughs] Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body.
I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.
Really?
Oh okay. [returns to the table] Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!
Follow me to the bathroom. [goes upstairs]
Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.
Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it! [Butters grabs the door handle and shuts the door. Cartman waits for a few second before doing anything] Well, Butters?!
Well pull harder!
Try doin' it faster.
Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!
The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!
Let's go! [They leave. Butters remains in the bathroom]
[in hushed tones] Kyle!
[repeats the gestures] I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!
Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them. [hops down from the porch and walks away]
Why not?
Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!
Yeah! This was our hot lead!
Dammit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!
All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo! [moves out from behind the couch, shooting slowly but walking normally] Wwwaaahhh!
We got her back safe. Lost a lot of good men in the process.
Kewl!
Uh bonus?
Me neither.
[intervening] Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!
Awwwwrrr-auugh. [hangs up his coat and holster on the coat tree in the living room]
We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.
[turns and snaps at her] Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?! [realizes what he's doing, then turns away] Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.
[straightens up and smiles] Okay. [turns and walks off to bed. He passes by the bathroom. Butters is still in there]
[stops] Butters?
Are you still trying to give a semen sample?
Well, keep tryin', Butters.
[thinks] A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?
Uh oh...
Bang bang bang... [the boys move behind a chair. The men continue firing. The boys move back into view]
[looks at Kenny] Kenny, it doesn't go "Pakew! Pakew!", it goes "BANG BANG BANG!!" [outside, police cars of all types pull up to the club. Dawson quickly jumps out of his car. An explosion appears in two windows of the club, and Dawson ducks a little]
[walks up with some clothes] Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five. [Kenny hands him a card] On your American Express.
You did?
Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?
Man, Indians have it good, huh?
[eagerly] All right, let's go! [moves forward]
I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!
Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude. [Kyle remains baffled, even as he looks at Cartman]
Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!
That's right!
[rises and moves to the sidewalk] Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go! [trots off excitedly. The other boys just watch him leave. Cartman returns a few seconds later] No? We can't give Kyle AIDS?
Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.
Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!
You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies! [follows his friends them out. The adults just watch]
What? Tell us?
Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!
[begins to laugh at him] What a dork!
Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! [laughs heartily]
Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. [Stan inspects Kyle's jacket]
We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.
That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.
[moves in front of Kyle] Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!
Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!
GOD I HATE CRAIG!! [Stan and Kenny turn to leave] That son of a... djah!! [leaves. Kyle turns to leave, but has second thoughts.]
You're straight like a freeway!
You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!
...So? I'm half bisexual!
I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.
Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.
Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-
Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second? [pulls Stan and Kenny away from Kyle] Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.
We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.
Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.
You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.
He's not our friend. [Stan's jaw drops a bit. Cartman looks at Stan and walks away. Kenny follows]
Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.
[steps forward] That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.
Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! [turns and walks away. Kenny just looks at him and walks off. Kyle looks away, then back at the boys, then walks away in the opposite direction. He stops, thinks for a while, then turns around and hurries to them]
God dammit! [hangs his head and lets the mic stand fall into his left hand. All stop playing and the side door opens]
[cackling] Heheheheheh heheheheheh.
[stops] Inspiration. Wait a minute, [turns right and walks away from them] that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?
[turns around] Our band should play Christian rock! [beams with pride]
[races back to the band] Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!
[protests, takes a step towards Kyle] It worked for Creed!
[steps towards Stan] You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!
Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!
Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! [runs out as fast as his fat little body will let him, and pants]
Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! [runs up to a house and pounds on the front door. The door opens up and it's Butters who answers]
Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! [dashes off]
No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle! [pounds on the door and Token answers] Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! [turns around and dashes off]
[spins around] Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! [runs off. Token gets annoyed and shuts the door]
Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. [makes changes to the sheet music on the piano's sheet music holder]
I told you, Token.
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.
We are going to start... a Christian rock band.
Wait! [Token stops, Cartman rushes over] Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- [points to Butters]
Still want to leave, Token? [Token thinks a bit, then resumes his place] Thank you.
All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them. [some sheet music is shown. Cartman has already crossed out the original author's name] See? All we have to do is cross out words like "baby" and "Darling" and replace them with [writes next to "baby"] Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat. [Butters doesn't understand, but starts drumming. It's rather good] Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.
[Sighs, has his left fist on his forehead, eyes shut] Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.
Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! [Token begins to play a bass line, then is surprised that he can actually do it, then realizes that Cartman is right]
 All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. [begins to sing]
Almost there, you guys.
Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover. [sets up his camera on a tripod] The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.
[when Token seems out of earshot] I'm going to kill you one day, Token.
Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. [begins to focus the shot. Butters and Token stand together]
No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! [Butters and Cartman move apart. Token moves off to a boulder a little farther away, Butters moves a bit closer to the camera]
No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!
Token, look away to the right. [Token looks off to the right] More. [Token turns his head to the right] More!
So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it! [starts the timer, then steps into the shot] Our first album cover.
Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.
[walks up] Oh hey guys. How's it going?
[brushes off Kyle's comment] I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band, [brings out the CD] Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.
That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya! [tugs at one of the lobes on Kyle's hat] Hahahaha ha ha!
It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.
I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! [walks off]
Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..
[takes the woman's body and puts it in the treasurer's box] I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.
Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.
[listening backstage, moves away a big] Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! [a group of men walk by]
Who are you?
Yeah, you guys are real hardcore.
Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.
[edges over to a storage room with an open door] Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better. [enters. The members of Sanctified follow him in] Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... [quickly runs out and locks the band in, then props a chair up against the doorknob so the band can't get out]
You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.
Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.
Yes, we sure do.
[turns the tables] Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??
Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??
I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.
Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.
Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.
I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!
The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned!
Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.
Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.
We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole. [addresses the milling crowd] There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive and join Cartman onstage] Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!
[deferring] Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on. [grabs the mic and addresses the crowd] Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? [the crowd cheers wildly]
Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. [Kyle is awfully pissed. A technician lowers a lever and stage lights bathe the boys]
Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. [basks in the moment]
[takes the album] Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?
You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!
GOD DAMMIT!! [throws his plaque onto the ground, where it shatters. The myrrh album falls away and the crowd is stunned]
Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!
OH, FUCK JESUS!! [deep gasp from the crowd. A woman screams loudly in disbelief]
[pounces onto him] Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! [The crowd screams in disbelief and scatters about]
Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole!
[yawns] Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.
Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.
[providing his own play-by-play] With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again [the ball bounces off Cartman's girth], proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!
I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.
Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.
[slowly] Calm down! We cannot understand you!
Old people!
Oh God, they're coming! [the other boys mutter other things]
They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?
My God, he's right. [the boys climb in, strap themselves in, and Cartman offers a quick prayer] Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death. [Marvin starts up the car and groans a bit] Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys. [a few moments later] Except for you, Kyle.
I believe that's us... thank God. [Marvin pulls over to the side and stops. Barbrady stops as well and approaches the driver side.]
More old people!
Old people gone mad!
So our only solution is to cut off their life force.
No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply. [runs his finger along the map to its destination] Here.
Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.
Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.
I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.
We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people. [they appear from the sides of buildings dressed in black and then gather in front of one of them] At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town. [they head for a train at the South Park Train Station and climb into a caboose. Kenny pulls on the horn] Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office[the elderly guards sleep standing up and fail to take notice of any sound] and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed.
Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside.
Yeah!
Aw yeah!
Well, right, or we could always do that.
Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.
Who's joking? [a door opens and closes offscreen]
You have AIDS?
[stands up] Wow! Casa Bonita?!
Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and [holds out his hand wide] all kinds of stuff!
This Saturday! Awesome! [begins to sing to "La Cucaracha"] Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere. [begins to snap his fingers] Casa Bonita!
You... your Mom said you could take three friends.
Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?
Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
I have never been a dick to you.
Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?
[Cartman thinks back as well] Okay, except maybe for that one time.
Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place [Kyle turns around] in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! [holds his hands together in a sign of pleading]
[turns irate and flips him off] Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day! [shoves the middle finger close to Kyle's face] Kiss my balls, asshole!!! [turns and walks away. The front door opens, closes, and opens again. Cartman returns and apologizes] Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle. I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.
[turns irate and flips him off again] Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! [turns and walks away. The front door opens, then closes]
Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys! [waves them on. Next scene is him getting a large platter of food] Oh, awesome!! [next scene is him waving his friends to a cave] Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave! [next scene is him by a waterfall] Wow, cliff divers! [a cliff diver takes a dive from the top of the waterfall. Next scene is Cartman on his third dish] More sopapillas, please! [next scene has him dancing in front of a low stage, on which a mariachi quartet plays its songs. An image of Kyle floats through his dream]
[with more foods on his plates, the dream dissolves. He's pulled up and away] No! Noooo! [he's pulled out of Casa Bonita and floats away] Casa Bonita! Noooo! [startled out of his dream] AAAAH!! [catches his breath] Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!
[looking quite presentable] Hi Kyle. [smiles]
What isn't it?
...I don't understand the difference.
Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up! [Annie and Red walk by at the far end of the hall. Jimmy stops] Dude, uh I need your help on something.
Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how "do" you act nice to people?
Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?
Like what?
Who's there?
Take that, Jimmy! [strikes him again, and Jimmy falls away] And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again! [Kyle stops by and looks. Cartman glances at him] Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?! [looks at Kyle] Oh, Kyle. Hey.
Uh... [turns and runs towards Kyle] He-hey Kyle! Knock knock. [follows him around the corner] Knock knock, Kyle!
Hey Kyle.
Well what?
I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.
So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.
I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. [turns and walks away]
I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.
Good.
Sweet, whatever. [walks on, then mouths to himself] Bingo!
[leads him to a telescope, then turns] Butters, can you keep a secret?
For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.
A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.
Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think. [backs up and looks through the eyepiece] Do you see anything?
Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.
Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? [Butters looks through again and Cartman holds up the wad, moving it closer to the objective lens.]
Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.
I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations. [heads for his desk and pulls out a calculator] 10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.
According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.
No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!
Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! [heads out the door]
Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! [opens the shelter's lid]
[reaches the shelter floor] All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.
No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
[looks away] I'm not sure of anything anymore. [turns and climbs up the ladder. He makes it out and looks down] Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.
Well, you know, with your wiener. [Butters just stares back] Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. [leaves and closes the lid, then locks it]
[bearing a gift] Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.
Hope you have a good one. See you later. [turns around and walks toward the street]
Yes?
[enters the house] Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?
Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.
[gets excited] Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!
[lowers his head and walks towards the front door] Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters. [brightens up] Well, let's get going, shall we?
[a little stunned] Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...
Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the... [catches himself and waits for a reaction. None comes] In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.
[left alone] Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!
[suddenly looks in, looking terribly roughed up] Butters!
Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!
[faking fatigue] The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...
There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. [coughs]
No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...
We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. [strains a bit, like he's gonna cough]
Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild. [coughs] I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday. [moves off] G-goodbye! [locks the lid down once again] All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.
[not spoken, he's thinking this while the captain speaks.] Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. [closes his eyes and begins anticipating. Three images come up. The first is of his waitress bringing him food, the second is of him dancing before a mariachi band, the third is of the cliff divers. He begins to dance while he daydream]
What what what?
UUuuugh!! [runs off]
[scrambling down the ladder] Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!
The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!
They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.
We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box! [picks it up and promptly drops it over Butters so Butters can't see a thing.] There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.
Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. [guides him to the ladder and nudges him up] There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top. [Butters climbs out] Good.
Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. [walks off. Butters follows]
Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.
We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.
Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here. [steps to the other side and begins making noises, then steps back] Oh my God!
It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! [steps to the other side and begins making noises, then steps back]
We've got to fight them off! [jabs at the air a few times] Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope! [makes "cannibal" noises] Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!
[picks up a twig] Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? [goes to Butters' other side and begins breaking off pieces of the twig as he makes more "cannibal" noises.]
Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh! [swings it and kills the "cannibal"] Die! [one last jab, the "cannibal" "croaks" and it's over]
[feigns exhaustion] The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me, [checks out his hand] which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.
We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!
Look! There's an old refrigerator! [reaches it and opens it] Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!
Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change. [begins to "change"] No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.
I love you too, man. I just [goes into spasms] You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! [lunges at Butters, who quickly closes the refrigerator door. Cartman walks up and rips off the door handle, then walks away chuckling to himself. A few seconds later a garbage truck backs up and removes the refrigerator from the gas station]
Hah! [turns off his bear alarm clock, hops out of bed cheerfully and skips to his wall calendar he made just for the occasion.] It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday! [crosses off Tuesday on his calendar] Only three more days till Casa Bonita. I'm gonna go through Black Bart's Cave first. No! I'm gonna watch the cliff divers first! Maybe if I tell them it's my birthday, they'll let me cliff-dive in the pool! [walks off to get dressed] Oh, that would be so bad-ass!
We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.
[sniffs] "Pretty cool." So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.
What? Fuck Kyle. [the others look at him in astonishment] Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.
Happy Birthday to you. Happy- [looks at the other boys for support]
We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita! [the boys climb out of the car] Aw man, this is gonna be so great!
But... Casa Bonita.
[turns to face Casa Bonita] But I... [turns back] but... [suddenly takes Kyle hostage] Stand back!
[backs up towards the restaurant with Kyle still hostage] I... am going... to Casa... Bonita! [sirens are heard]
[hauls Kyle away a bit longer] Ah! Eh. Nuh! [throws him away and dashes for the entrance] Less than a minute! Less than a minute!
Oh, awesome!! [approaches a table which has a family enjoying its dinner] Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your- [grabs some food from both the mother's plate and the father's plate] Thank you. Thank you. [climbs over the table] Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave! [hops off and runs for the cave, barging his way past two other kids] Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave! [runs in] Oh! [stops at a treasure chest with a pirate skeleton beside it] Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton! [moves on] Oh man, I'm so scared! [exits]
Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers! [rushes to them, stopping long enough to dance before the mariachi band] Come on! Come on, dive! [atop the waterfall, a cliff diver stands ready] Dive, asshole! [the diver dives into the pool below] Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh? [looks towards the entrance and sees the rest of his party and the police enter the restaurant] Whoa. [dashes for the jail set at the Photo Flash Back. He puts on the suit waiting for the next customer and looks out from behind bars. His picture is taken and he quickly jumps down from the cell. He moves on to the table he dreamt about two weeks ago] Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?! [a waitress arrives with a plate of sopapillas] Sweeet! [runs off with it and heads for a new attraction] Oh! Booth! Puppet show! Puppet show! [an officer steps in and blocks his way, he tosses his dessert away and turns back]
[steps left] Ah. [steps right] Uh. [moves around a bit more, then jumps off the cliff] Yeeeesss!
Totally. [smiles]
[falsetto] Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.
Yeah. Somebody needs to put him in him place!
Go kick his ass, Stan.
Will he bleed? That's all we care about.
Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan! [then, when Stan is gone, softly] All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?
They're just standing there, talking. [A few moments later, Stan returns defeated. He glances back at Gary, then approaches the other boys]
You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!
Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?
[cooing] Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.
Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.
[playing it up] Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?
Oh my God...
[backs away a bit with Kyle and Kenny] Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. [looks at the other two. All three move off to their left and leave]
Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. [an awkward moment between Gary and Stan follows]
[needling] Oh no! You guys broke up?
Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.
Damn, that kid is cool, huh?
I'm going to kill myself. [return to the rap, which soon ends and Butt Out!'s Kyle goes back in line]
You guys, Kenny's eating his own hands. [Kenny's mittens are against his lips. Stan and Kyle are half asleep]
Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey. [the boys quickly turn away and toss the cigarettes and lighter into the trash bin]
[in clipped tones] Nothing.
Nothin' Na- Due-nothing. [moments later Stan sneezes, and a large amount of snot ends up on his face and jacket]
Gross dude! [with the stifles broken, the boys resume coughing]
No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes.
We're sorry.
Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?
[agreeing] Yeah, huh? [launches into a small demonstration] It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!
Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.
Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?
Got it! [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
[impressed] Isn't he awesome, you guys?
Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. [pics up an onion ring and munches on it]
Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.
[strokes his chin] Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.
Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them. [cuddles up to Reiner] You are so awesome.
Oh my God, that is what I've always said. [motions to Reiner] I love this guy!
[eagerly] Wow, a commercial?
God, he's just the best! [rushes off to follow Reiner] Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?
So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!
[confused] Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?
Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, "How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't [poke] gonna [poke] work [poke] on [poke] me [poke] ha [poke] ha [poke] ha [poke]. Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on. [leaves]
Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now. [Cartman forgets that hallway doors open in to their respective rooms] Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- [Kyle appears next to him with a glass of water]
[drops his hammer in this awkward moment] Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man. Wait, this isn't my house.
Hahahahahaha! [resumes hammering] Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!
[giddily] Heh, okay. [the make-up crew leave]
Heh, okay, okay. [takes a deep breath, then strikes a somber pose] You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead. [takes a closer look at that last line, then looks at Reiner] Dead??
Uh what... what does that mean, "I'll be dead"? Hey, uh what, what was that "dead" part?
Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.
[pushes the cupcake away] I'm not eating the cupcake.
[realizes what the words he said mean and bolts from the stool] Jesus Christ! HAAAA!
They're going to kill me! [walks to the other window and looks out]
The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!
[draws close] You guys have to help me!
[draws close] Please, you guys, I don't know what to do!
If I go, you guys go!
Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! [the boys keep their distance]
Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! [crosses his arms]
You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company!
[approaches Reiner] I don't idolize you anymore, asshole! [takes the fork Reiner was holding and jabs it into his belly, Reiner begins to deflate as fat gushes out of the punctures Cartman made with the fork]
Aw awww!
Right. What are we playing again?
Got it. [the teams get into position]
What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!
Yeh-heah, right!
What a whore! [turns around and goes back to the game. The other boys do the same. Stan is too stunned to move]
[turns around] Come on, Stan, it's first down still. [Butters looks back, then Kenny. Stan loses heart and walks off slowly, his head hanging low. The other boys look at each other, unsure what to make of that. A montage begins.]
God, what a fag!
How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.
Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts [Lexus winks at Butters] and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.
[really stuffed, with a soiled face] Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... [their meals have been served]
Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.
We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!
Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmas time.
I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.
Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. [walks off in the direction of the other boys. Kyle walks off sadly in the other direction]
HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!
What?
No! No, this can't be happening! [Kenny, Heidi and Clyde remain there as well. Clyde begins to cry.]
You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!
Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!! [Stan and Kenny walk in behind him] You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!! [lunges after Kyle] AAAAAA!! [Stan and Kenny jump in and hold him back]
It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!
[takes off his mittens and coat] This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.
You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?
Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.
We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas. [this sets it at 8 p.m. December 22] That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.
[shakes his head vigorously] Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!
You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
Of course I care about Christmas- oh, Christ on a stick! [he and Kenny head for the plane]
Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!
Sweet.
Look out!
Oh Jesus Christ.
Which road?!
[checking his watch] Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. [a mountie appears]
But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.
Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!
How much further to Ottawa?! Christmas is only twelve hours away.
[glaring at Rick] How could you be so stupid!
Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down! [puts up his fists] Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! [grabs Kyle by the collar]
We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.
[hops off the boat and runs towards Parliament] Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! [the rest of the group follows]
And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. [sits on the steps]
[through his tears] I'm gonna kill you, Kyle.
It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.
Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents! [takes off his mittens] And what did I tell you, Kyle?! [unbuttons his jacket, takes it off, and bunches it up] I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! [tosses his jacket away]
Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now! [puts up his fists] We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!! [Kyle puts up his fists and gives Cartman a quick right hook across the face. Cartman blinks a few times and begins to bawl] Mooooooom! Moooooooom!
Pfaha, so funny. [pulls out another firecracker, tosses it before Kyle, and cackles]
Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.
Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!
I'm gonna get those killer sai. [swords with horns at the hilt are in there. Cartman notices a weapon off to the right] Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken [ninja star] for a dollar ninety nine.
Parents? Parents?! [fakes a sob] Oh God! [starts sobbing loudly and turns away.]
Why?! [Stan cries, then covers his eyes. Cartman turns around, still sobbing] Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?! [Kenny begins to sob] Why?! [Kyle observes his friends, then joins them in the sobbing]
Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you! [lunges] Iya!
[already transformed] Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies
Kick ass! [the boys head out]
Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous.
Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!
Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true.
Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. [the boys approach quickly]
[shows off his sai] Look what we got.
[moves past Stan] Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.
Ugh.
Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril. [he and the other two turn and walk away as well] Come on, ninjas!
Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!
We're playing Ninjas, Butters.
No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.
Yes, and no time to do it. No time... [Butters stands in the open alone]
Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.
I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
I have the power to have all the powers I want.
[protests] C'mon!
Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.
That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!
All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay! [Cartman attempts to unleash energy with his hands, but nothing happens.] Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!
All right! And now I will use my power to... [faces the other boys] turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! [in an instant Kyle becomes a chicken]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
Oh, shit, dude!
Guys, meeting over here for a second? [the boys move off and huddle] All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard.
Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.
[approaches] Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle. [to the huddle] Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.
Shut up, Butters. [to the other boys] Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. [puts his fingertips to his temples. Kenny touches his right temple, Stan, his chin]
Dr. Shafley?
So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...
Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. [Kyle hands him the glue]
Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!
Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.
Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.
In here! [opens its door and shoves Butters in]
No way, you got weapons too?!
Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!
[the boys are back in anime form] We're twice the ninjas you fags are!
Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!
Butters!
Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!
We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!
Here, Butters!
Butter- Butters!
Here, Butters!
[with his sais] Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!
Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.
Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming "NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!" You know this to be true. [Kyle continues struggling and begins to grunt] Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle. [closeup of Cartman's lips] Do it. [Kyle struggles even harder, but eventually gives in]
All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.
I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold. [steps aside and holds his arms up. He sweeps them down and disappears. He them removes his clothes and gathers them into a pile] This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected. [walks over to Stan and hands his clothes over] Here, hold this stuff for me.
What?
I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. [the adults go into an uproar again]
Hey, fuck you, Kyle!
[approaches Jimmy] The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?
[snickers] What?
Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.
What? What'd I do?
[rushes up with the brochure] You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!
Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: "At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000" [he looks at his friends as his jaw drops]
So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!
It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!
Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. [walks off]
Why?
What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?! [points an accusing finger at him] Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale! [lowers it] Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle! [turns around and walks off. Kyle seethes in silence. Cartman now talks to himself] All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.
Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics. [loosens the chin straps and lowers his face to normal] Bull's eye!
Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey. [the boys stop and look] Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr.
You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away. [This means it's Tuesday prior] I'm going to go sign up now.
What?! [takes the brochure back from Kyle]
Moooommmm?
Um, could I get you to do something for me?
Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars? [Liane looks up and goes pale]
I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.
...I'll split the money with you. [Liane stops]
[walks up to the table] All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth. [under his breath] God, this is gonna be hard to say. [normally] I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change. [looks up at her with longing] Help me change?
Awesome.
[looking really retarded, steps up to the table with his mom] Naaaa! Daaaaa!
Naaaa!
Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!
...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!
Enter. [Kyle enters, and walks up next to Cartman]
Go on, Kyle.
Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion of the Jew.
Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.
Yes. [hops off his seat and consoles Kyle] And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle. [whispers] Good luck. [after a few seconds, Kyle turns around and goes to leave. He opens the door, turns around to say something but instead walks out. Cartman just hums a tune, goes back to the computer and reads some more.]
One thousand dollars, yeah!
[hobbles into the fifth position on the track] Daaaa! Daaaa!
Whoa. What the hell?? [the girl in position 6 breaks the tape. Cartman hobbles past the finish line four seconds later]
Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.
[trips over a hurdle] God-damnit!
All right, this one I can win! [drops his pole, takes off his helmet and gives it to another athlete] Here, hold this! [takes up his pole and aims] I'll show you Goddamned retards! [runs up to the posts, plants his pole, and sails up, but the pole won't straighten out. It flexes a few time before it breaks, sending Cartman back down to the track, where he lands on his back]
God-damnit!
Ah, screw you hippies!
...I could pile at Shakey's, heck. [puts on his helmet and walks up] Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!
[humbly] Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh.
Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids. [he looks at Kyle and then Stan for a reaction, but neither offers any. He frowns, then steps forward angrily] Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes! [straightens up] Grow up! [walks off in a huff]
[in the driver's seat] Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.
What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
All right, hang on. We're about to land. [the boys make landing noises, with Stan finishing off with a thump. Cartman removes his seatbelt] Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.
[looks back] It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!
Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
Set phasers on stun.
Yes. A little too quiet.
Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it! [the boys take their positions and start firing away] Oh no, it got Kyle!
Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off! [pretends to be the monster ripping Kyle's head off] Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!
Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!
How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.
Go see the movie, Kyle!
You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.
[focuses Kyle's attention to him] Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.
Sweet, now I can just play with myself. [fires off his phaser] Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! [races into the minivan]
Mom! Doorbell!
[the doorbell rings] Mom! Answer the door!
God damn it, lazy-ass whore. [gets up and answers the door himself.]
It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?
[closes his eyes and relishes the moment] Mmm, one more time, Kyle.
I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done. [a shot of Mel Gibson's poster, without the "Braveheart" on it.] Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.
Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.
Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.
What?
You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.
If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!
Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
Eup. [hangs up and skulks away]
Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.
[turns right so his profile will look sharp as well] Tell them I'll be down shortly
[wields his short whip]Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. [a shot of the poster.]
Ah, hello everyone. Achtung. [the last few standing people take their seats] My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club. [applause] Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.
But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps. [the guests fall silent]
[bows a few times] Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we [his face turns ugly] all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.
Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.
One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message! [some applause] Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world! [the crowd applauds] Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!
And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say "Es ist Zeit für Säuberung," you all chant back "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."
[pounds the table a few times] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! [his hair gets messed up from the impacts]
Es ist Zeit fër Rache!
[picks a mark in front of the crowd] All right, everyone! Forward, march! [they all move forward] Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Nice.
[from outside] Es ist Zeit für Rache! [congregants rise and face the doors in the back, others look out the windows. They see Cartman leading a march past the synagogue]
Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Es ist Zeit für Rache!
[points] Juden!
Mel! Gibson! [brightens and approaches him, then grovels at his feet] Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding! [grovels some more] Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!
Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. [a car goes up a ramp and jumps off]
Ha! You just got f'd in the a!
Yeah!
All right!
All right, Butters!
[monotone] Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
Yes. I will be your new best friend.
Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.
[snickers] Really?
Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.
[laughs] That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.
Oh, really?
Heh. Wow, that sucks.
Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.
What?
You saw that?
Nuh uh.
No way.
[beat] ...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?
Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?
Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
[moments later, still on the bed] Oh, son of a bitch!
AWESOM-O does not have a mom.
[under his breath] Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this. [normal. Butters opens up the medicine cabinet] Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?
I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?
What?
Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.
...No way.
Weak! [turns right and faces Butters' ass.]
Lame!
AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.
Where is it? Where is it?!
Wah!
Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.
AWESOM-O understands.
Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!
I would like some Sunny Delight too.
[turns] AWESOM-O will answers the door. [walks towards the door as Butters leaves and opens it. He sees Stan, Kyle, and Kenny]
[normal voice] Shh! [lifts up the helmet part of the outfit] I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer.
Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay?
Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?
[monotone] Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.
Weak.
Yes, of course. [begins to walk towards the kitchen]
Suck my balls, Kyle. [resumes his walk]
Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.
What?
Lame.
AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please?
Thank you. [walks in the direction Aunt Nellie points to]
Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming. [finishes off the tube, hops down, and tosses the tube aside]
Argh! [heads out.]
Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps?
The New Orleans Saints. [everyone around them laughs, and the producers approach]
Seventeen. [everyone laughs again]
Um... okay. How about this: [the staffers take pen to paper and anticipate the ideas] Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something.
Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something.
You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.
[growing desperate, walks around] Haaaa! Haaaa!
AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.
Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.
...What?
AWESOM-O does not understand.
[from the boardroom] Lame!
Not cool! Totally lame! [runs to his left. Butters looks over his shoulder]
Waaaaa!
Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa!
Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?!
The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!
I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive!
I said I'm a real person, asswipe!
Goddamnit, get me down from here! [the military approaches him]
[enunciating] I'm not a robot, I'm a human!
Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!
[fidgets frantically] Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!
Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass!
No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! [raises his helmet enough to show his eyes]
I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
Uh... now ending fart sequence.
Smell sequence initiated.
[rapping]
Lame...
I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. [a door is heard opening]
No.
Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now.
Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. [they turn away.]
Oh my God, this is awesome! [runs up to a claw machine]
[guiding the machine's arm to grab a plush toy] Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!
Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!
[breathless] They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! [his chest heaves noticeably]
They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.
Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!
Choo-choo train! Yay!
Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.
Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.
...Train together
I've got time. Do youuu??
Choo-choo train.
Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!
You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it! [faces Kyle down] Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! [turns and walks away angrily]
What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!
He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were, [Stan steps back...] and I-
Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!
Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!
Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. [a knock is heard at Stan's door]
Deeper.
Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! [Stan, Kyle, and Sharon are shocked]
Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?
Mr. Jefferson, hello?!
[hops to Mr. Jefferson's defense, standing in front of him] No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson! [a crowd, including the boys' parents, gathers] All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!
Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.
[sweetly] Hello ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?
Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!
It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work! [moments later, Stan and Kyle are clearing the driveway while Kenny clears the front lawn, moving by Cartman, who is now seated on the steps talking on a cell phone] Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool. [Kyle walks up to him and stops] No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak. [notices Kyle, then lowers the phone] What?
Dude, I'm takin' a break.
Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.
It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?
Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!
Shoveling accident.
You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.
What?! Who?!
We can't understand you, asshole! [the cashier's manager comes up and talks to him for a bit. The cashier points at the boys. The manager takes over and resets the order]
Look, it's working! [one by one, the immigrants vanish from view]
Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.
Butters, shut the hell up! [As Mooey dances, PETA bursts in through the double doors and rushes towards the cheerleaders. They apprehend Mooey and begin beating him up, then pulling his head off]
Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.
Ye-heah!
Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Turd Sandwich."
Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!
It is not!
Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.
Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?
It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
A turd sandwich.
Turd sandwich.
Turd sandwich.
Awwwww!
Okay. You win, Kyle.
All right turd sandwich!
Giant Douche sucks!
Game on, Jew-boy!
Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives. [Butters begins tossing out the leis, and kids step forth to get them. A man shows up as well, but gets nothing] Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!
We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.
Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision. [pulls out a wrapped hard candy and shows it] Butterscotch candy?
Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?
You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.
So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?
Well then, perhaps we could interest you in [pulls out another wrapped candy] another butterscotch candy? [Clyde takes the candy and consumes that one as well]
[interrupts] Hey, fuck off, Kyle. [aside, about Puffy and his crew] Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings.
Aww, suck-up, suck-up! [a man behind him and to his right leans over and shushes him] What?! That's an obvious suck-up move.
Oh, no! Noooo!!
You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants.
Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. [laughs heartily. The other boys stop]
Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, asshole!
Whoa, awesome!
[the boys are in the movie aisle] Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!
Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!
Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!
Dude, you can't shop for crap. [a wide shot of the store]
Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?
What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.
What? That's called progress, Kyle.
... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks. [gives Kyle the finger, turns around, and walks away. Kyle watches him leave]
[catching up with the other boys] Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!
You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?
No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it.
Oh, awesome! [rushes towards Wall-Mart]
[Inside the store] Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents? [freezes in place and hears sounds] Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again? [turns a little angry] Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand. [with a look of determination, he leaves the store.]
[rushing up to join them] Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.
Nuh-uh.
I am not, Kyle!
[pulls out a knife from his back pocket] Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart.
You heard what?
That's not what I said! [Stan comes out to see what's going on]
[to himself] Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!
[drawing out the syllables] I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!
Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?
You speak too much, sir!
[pointing to Kyle] That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!
[rushes in and blocks their path. holding a dagger] I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along!
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-
[plugs his ears] I can't hear you! Lalalalalala! [once he's sure Kyle is quiet, he unplugs his ears and pulls out his dagger] I'm sorry, boys. But if you want to hurt the Wall-Mart, you'll have to go through me! [holds out the dagger, ready for battle.]
Very well, Kenny! Let us battle! [Kenny begins delivering blows at Cartman] Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off.
Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on?
Really? That's cool. When did- [realizes what Kyle has just said and stops completely in place] What did you say? [rushes up to Kyle] Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at us, Trent Boyett?!
Oh, Holy Jesus, God...
It's true.
He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.
Jews can't be firemen.
Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew!
But how do we start a fire?
Don't worry, Trent.
Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!
Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did.
Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
Whatever. That's like five years from now.
Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!
You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!
We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!
Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!
[now yelling] How the hell are condoms gonna help us?! [the adults in the recovery room look at Cartman] Sorry, heh. Never mind, hehe. [the adults turn their attention back to Butters]
[pulls each item from his backpack and presents it as he mentions it] A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin. [places it at the top of the small tower he's built] All this can be yours. [the Sixth Grade Leader steps off his bike, approaches Cartman, and throws the tower aside]
Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.
I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange. [crosses his arms] You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.
Nononono, you gotta go [softly, sweetly] "But Mo-o-o-om."
[with more feeling] "But Mo-o-o-om."
Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my ass cheeks.
Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.
Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!
All right!
You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!
Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass.
Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a- [drops his cone in fright] Huh?! [before them is a pile of mangled bikes]
He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls. [breathes a silent sigh]
A picture of your mom's boobs?
A lot of stupid things that we regret.
Aaaaaaaah!
Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth. [the boys hide behind Ms. Claridge's wheelchair, Trent goes around the other side and faces them behind the chair]
Stay away from us, Trent!
It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse. [steps forward] Just back off, man!
I am not going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!
Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
Whatever, that's like five years from now.
We did it! [walks over to the side of the cruiser Trent is sitting in] So long, Trent! Have a nice time! [Trent grits his teeth in anger as Cartman dances] Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! [turns around and lowers his pants, then shakes his bare at him] Hahahahahaaahaaa! [he forgot to remove the nipple markings from it. Trent grows livid. The six-graders arrive and carry Cartman away]
Uh oh.
Hah! Hey!
And I'm Rick Cartman.
Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.
[serious pose] ...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?
All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.
Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.
Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.
All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice. [the reporters gather in studio]
How many students is that?
What is that butthole doing now?!
Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.
...You're gay!
Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.
[softly] God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park.
Go play with yourself, Craig.
[catches up to Kenny] Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!
You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that! We've always been supercool to you! [Kenny flashes back to Cartman gloating about their news show]
It should be Sexy News.
Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.
Nice, Butters, write that down!
And panda bears for the preschoolers.
We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means.
Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you? [takes Token by the arm and walks him away from the door] Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.
You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha-, how should I say... white. [Sees that Token isn't following] Token, all the great African-Americans news people have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings.
Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls!
And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.
[rudely interrupting] Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?
[cracks up with laughter, then holds up a finger] One testicle! [pounds the desk and laughs] What an asshole! [a short jingle is heard]
Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters.
All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle.
Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got skidmarks Monday.
It's boring news, Jimmy.
All right, tell me about it.
[yawns loudly] Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! [hugs Butters]
I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!
How about we have us, um... hmmm.
Wait, I've got it. [the boys turn and look at him] Crab people.
They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.
[his face buried in his hands] Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!
How about we do a show where we kill Butters? [time marches on and the boys get sleepy, except for Butters]
We have crab people. Just sayin'.
That sounds perfect.
[taps at his notepad several times with a pencil] Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.
[appears as a blob with echoing voice] Stan, are you getting good ideas?
[with altered voice] Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog. [smiles, turns around and walks away]
Oh dude, I just got the best idea!
Dude, this TV show is awesome.
I-I did. I wrote something down. [reaches down and gets his tablet] Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. [shows the drawing to the other boys]
[camera pans down to him] They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse.
And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.
[gleefully] Haha! In your face, Craig!
This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head. [Token and Kyle sit across from him with no ideas either]
...I think bail.
"Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure." [the girls say nothing. Cartman stops, gets angry, and walks back to the first girl he saw, then flips each one of them off. He flips Red off with both hands.] Fuck you Millie, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! [leaves.]
[dressed very casually, with hair slightly unkempt] Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party.
Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.
Kelly Rutherfordmenskin.
Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter?
[under his breath] Oh, Goddammit!
This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.
[assessing the situation] ...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here.
I'm gonna!
Okay, here we go. [steps forward and gets ready to launch himself] Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-
Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.
And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! [he flaps his cardboard wings a few times to get some lift, then jumps off the roof. He heads straight for the ground and lands on his face with a grunt. All the boys are shocked and stand there frozen for several seconds. Stan is the first to leave, then Kyle, then the rest of them. Only Butters remains, and he turns to watch the others leave. After a few seconds of uncertainty, he leaves too.]
Eugh... [sits up, his eyes still closed.]
Wheh? Where am I?
Coma... How long?
Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!
Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!
Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!
Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.
I don't know, I just knew it. [receives the tray from the nurse and sniffs] Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!
How come the outline is missing its hand?
Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles... [he sees a hand holding Double-Stuff Oreo] Double-Stuff Oreos... [a second hand comes up and twists off the lower cookie] He ... He's taking the top of one and... [squeezes his eyes closed and sees another Oreo attached to the first one so there are two fillings between the cookies] ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs! [the detective writes down what Cartman is seeing] I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!
Guess again.
Wow!
I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.
Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! [shows off the money]
Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?
Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!
Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!
Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! [closes his eyes and starts making sound effects and hand motions. The boys behind Kyle except Stan and Kenny scatter, and the detectives spot him as they enter the school.]
What?
I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!
No. Nothing.
Wait a minute. [his right arm twitches and he sees a bucket of chicken, then sees some chicken served next to the powdered doughnuts he saw earlier. His eyes are squeezed tight.] Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh! [sees some syrup poured onto the chicken] There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!
It is fried chicken! [first he sees a plate of fried chicken, then the maple syrup, then some whipped cream, then some chocolate syrup, then a cherry on top...] Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.
Proper channels?
I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.
[laughs at them] Ten percent, my balls, get lost!
Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!
In court?
Cool. [the doorbell rings and Cartman concentrates] Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle! [the door opens and the weird man from the crime scenes enters and approaches Cartman] Who are you?
... 'Kay. Sweet.
Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second. [hops off the sofa, walks away a bit, and calls out] Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away. [the weird man quickly advances and smothers Cartman's face with a cloth, making Cartman inhale chloroform. Cartman passes out.]
Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?!
I don't even know you dude!
Oh, Jesus.
No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!
[nervously] Heheh.
Yes yes, I see! [another Mount Rushmore picture is shown, with the man looking at the camera this time]
AAAAAAAH!
Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! [the doorbell is heard. The two detectives are outside, Yates ringing the doorbell. Michael Deets opens the door]
(Hey! Come over here!)
[in the basement] (Hey! Help!) [upstairs, Mr. Deets closes the front door]
No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.
Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna- [spots the detectives descend the stairs and approach the room] I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you! [begins to concentrate and make noises]
You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.
You can't hurt me.
I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. [behind him on the board is written "Write Your Own Christmas Story Day"]
Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?
[closes his booklet] All right, fine! Forget it! [He drops off the stool and heads for his desk.]
Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.
That's not at all what happens.
[He returns to the stool and resumes the story. He clears his throat.] "Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
