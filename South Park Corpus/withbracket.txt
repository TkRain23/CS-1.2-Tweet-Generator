I know what it means!
I'm not telling you.
He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right! [Kyle swings Ike by his feet, knocking Cartman down.] Ow! [Ike Laughs.]
That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.
Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed...
...in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room.
Then slowly my bedroom door began to open... [A Visitor peeks inside.]
...and then the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway.
Weeaak!
Then I was lying on a table...
...and these scary aliens wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes.
What?
No, it was just a dream, my mom said so.
Oh, shut up guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working.
Kick ass.
[Surprised.] Huh?
