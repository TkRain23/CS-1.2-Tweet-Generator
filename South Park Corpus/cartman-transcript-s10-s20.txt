I'm gonna miss him. [Butters walks forward a few steps and puts his hand on the sofa] I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him! [turns his head left and cries into his left arm]
[draws two and puts one down] Reverse to you, Jew. [the doorbell rings]
All right! [applause comes out of nowhere. Chef gives them a hug]
Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?
Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.
[The boys are stunned] Excuse me?
...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.
Yeah!
Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs. [they step off on the other side and approach the front door. Stan reaches over and pulls the rope that rings the house's bell. A black butler opens up]
Oh, son of a bitch!
No, Chef has always been super-cool.
So what can we do??
Come on, bitch! Dance!
Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!
It's ok Chef, Go on, remember!
Look, If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!
Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!
Run Chef!
A mountain lion! [the lion grabs at Chef's right arm, but is having trouble ripping it off]
A grizzly bear!
Maybe- maybe he's still okay. [the other boys look at him, dumbfounded] No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-
Oh never mind.
[walks into the living room with a pitcher and cups of pop] Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! [blows into a noisemaker and makes it stick out. Other kids walk up and take cups away]
Who? [smiles innocently]
Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?
You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! [Stan leaves]'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!
Dude, what are you doing?
THAT's gay, heh.
Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
[fears that for a moment, then] Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! [walks out]
Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!
You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.
No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!
Who?
[clearly doesn't know what's happening] The smug?
[puts on the gloves] I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.
You don't know San Francisco, Butters. [zips the suit up] It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old. [turns around and sighs] I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me. [reaches down, picks up the helmet, and puts it on, locks it in place, and pressurizes the suit. Communication resumes through the intercom] All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.
I'm not doin' it for Kyle. [turns around] I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. [begins to walk slowly and deliberately into the city]
[checking in] Butters, are you there?!
I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?
Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.
Turning right at O two four niner. [turns right at the corner and continues walking]
Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!
Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!
Oh my CHRIST! [runs up to Kyle's room and kicks the door open. Kyle and Ike are as wasted as Gerald and Sheila are. They sit on the floor with their backs against Ike's bed] Kyle? Kyle!
[trying to shake Kyle to his senses] We have to get out of here! Now! [lightning strikes the house, which begins to burn. The lights begin to flicker, and the camera zooms in on Cartman, who continues shaking Kyle] Kyle! Kyle!! [the screen goes black]
[walks up to Kyle] Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?
We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!
Ah, that's better. [smiles]
You TIVO every episode of Family Guy?
Yich. [Kyle has reached his target. The Family Guy living room is shown. Peter is in his armchair, the rest of the family is on the sofa]
Yich.
Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.
What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people. [Stan and Kyle look at each other in silence] What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!
That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!
I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!! [turns and heads for the front door, then turns back and aims his index fingers at the other boys] It's wrong! [opens the door, heads out, and closes it behind him. Kyle's parents walk in from the kitchen with their survival gear]
Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.
Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?
What?
Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!
You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!
We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?
Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.
If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!
Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?
All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny? [Kyle stifles an answer] What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle? [Kyle's jaw drops] I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right. [walks off]
Come to try and stop me?! [...a bigger box of Cheesy Poofs...] It isn't gonna work. [...a can of Dr. Pep-er, a can of lemon-lime soda...]
[...Snacky Cakes...] Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this. [...another can of Dr. Pep-er...] Especially one who doesn't trust me. [seals his knapsack shut]
[turns around slowly] Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.
You know we might not even make it into the studio.
So what made you change your mind?
Well Kyle, we'd better get going.
Are you set?
All right, let's roll! [they ride off, slowly]
Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.
It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.
[gets off his Big Wheels, his anger sudden and strong, and walks up to Kyle] Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! [turns and goes back to his Big Wheels]
Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, "Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?" "Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman." [turns and faces Kyle] I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! [begins to walk towards his Big Wheels]
Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?
Kyle, stop it!
Holy Crap! [swerves to the right]
Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!
[riding into the distance] Suck mah balls, Kyle! [Kyle sobs a little, then pounds his left fist into the sand along the side of the highway]
[...and reaches a slow, undulating glowing light, judging from the reflection coming off him] This... explains everything.
[he and Kyle fight in a burning studio] Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle!
I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.
Kyle, stop it!
So long, Kyle!
Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.
It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!
Dude, can I go before you?
So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?
So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?
Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.
Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.
...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.
This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.
Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?
Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.
Seeya.
[removes his cap] Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...
You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened. [shocked looks on the faces of the staff] First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility. [coughs] Ow..
I'll certainly do my best. [coughs] Ow.
[turns and walks out, and says softly with an evil smile] Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.
[stops and turns] I I said "thank you." Thank you for listening. [walks out again]
It won't take long, sir. [coughs with more energy] Ow...
[removes his cap] Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.
[stops and stares] Wha? [before him is a wall tank the height of the writing room. Manatees are swimming slowly within, and a huge pile of plastic balls sits at one end of the tank. Some of them are snacking on snall fish] What are they?
Family Guy is written by manatees? [rethinks] Of course, it all makes sense now.
Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!
Oh... yes, yes. Um [clears his throat and talks to the tank] hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-
Why not?
[softly] Son of a bitch.
[voice] Well well well! [now shown walking up to Bart, who's keeping watch while leaning on his skateboard. Cartman has a mean air of satisfaction on him]
Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.
You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.
Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.
Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle, [turns and walks away] I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.
[hobbles up to him] Sir! Sir! [faces him] If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you. [they both turn to face the tank] Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.
I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!
Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frère!
How the hell did you get out?
Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!
You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!
[runs ahead and cuts him off] I can't let you do that!
[takes off his mittens] Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable. [Kyle removes his left mitten with his teeth and spits it away] Let this be our final battle. [they put on their battle faces and begin fighting, which is shown dispassionately. It's all a long series of slaps] Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah! [they begin to move along a sidewalk] Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!
Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle! [throws him up against a wall. They slap each other some more and Kyle throws Cartman up against the wall. Some more fighting and Cartman throws Kyle up against a window, but they both crash through it into the King of the Hill offices.]
Stop it!
Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out. [Kyle stops his attack and a few seconds of silence follow. Then] Time in! [slaps Kyle hard. Kyle waits for a writer to stop staring, then resumes his attack] I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!
Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!
Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls! [throws Kyle off, but they resume fighting] Kyle! [Kyle finally gets Cartman in a reverse headlock. A few seconds later, he begins punching Cartman on the ribs] Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle! [gets out of the headlock, but the fighting resumes] Okay... Okay! Okay okay! [the fighting stops, and they're both panting] You win! You win. I give up. [kicks Kyle square in the nuts. Kyle doubles over in pain, coughing, and Cartman grins] Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed. [Kyle is still immobile, but a skateboard whacks Cartman from behind. Cartman falls over and Bart is there]
Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!
No! Think about the people who could get hurt!
Okay, I'll make it easy for you. [pulls out a gun and aims it at the president] Pull the Mohammad episode, now!
Shut up, Kyle!
Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!
No gay speeches, Kyle!
No! No, I hate Family Guy!! [tries to fire the gun, but it seems to be empty. No bullets come out. He throws it down.]
[giggles as he dribbles] Check out this sweet move. [tries to dribble around Kyle, but Kyle blocks him] Kyle, you can't block like that.
Hang on. I'm going to do something killer. [tries to fake Kyle out, but Kyle taps the ball away. Cartman goes after it] God damnit, stop it, Kyle!
[tries again, moving Kyle back some] All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. [keeps dribbling without making a move]
Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy! [again tries to get by Kyle, but Kyle taps the ball away again. Cartman chases it down again.] Kyle, knock it off! [the beast breaks through the bushes and steps onto the basketball court. Cartman continues to dribble]
Dude, what are you doing?
No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.
Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?
Ah I don't think so, dude. [the boys head for the door]
You... have that kind of power?
Somebody get us some help down hyah!
Hello??
[pointing at Stan] You'd better get us out of here, asshole!
You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!
[scrambling along his own path] This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off! [loses his footing and slides down some distance to the floor. He gets up and coughs from all the dust that went up around him] Goddammit! [reaches down and grabs his flashlight. He slaps it until it comes back on, coughs, and looks ahead. His eyes grow big. Before him is "Smuggle's Den," a corner of the cave in which sits an open treasure chest and two skeletons guarding it. Gold and jewelry are in and around the chest, while the skeletons have guns in their hands. Cartman approaches slowly, in awe]
[in a soft, trembling voice] No, nothing [clears his throat and speaks normally] No, nothing here! Nothing this way! [his eyes fixed on the look, he swoons] Tr... treasure.
I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! [turns to head back to the other boys, but turns around one last time to remember where the treasure is, then heads back to his friends.]
You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. [the other three boys turn to face him]
I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.
No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.
That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there [points to his last location] if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.
I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.
[softly throughout] All that treasure. [gets excited] It's all mine! [gets angry] So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it! [looks at the other boys] You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys! [begins to crawl towards Kyle] Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass! [reaches Kyle so that his face is smiling evilly down at Kyle's face. He whispers] Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. [Kyle stirs and wakes up]
[says nothing for a few seconds, then] Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?
Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?
Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. [gets off Kyle]
[determined] All right. Gotta be strong. [looks at the coins in his hands] There's still a lot more treasure to go. [begins to swallow the coins and wash them down with "WOTTUR." He soon runs into some difficulty swallowing and drinking, so it seems like he's puking. The other three boys are awake and listening with concern]
Meh, meuh urgh. [coughs] Mbeuh.
[cough] I'm fahn. Just a lit- [gulp] No big deal. [burps] Beh.
NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. [coughs]
Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here. [grunts, and a fart comes out. His face lights up in alarm]
You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! [the boys pull again.]
Yes you do! [something drops, and the roar of flooding water is heard]
No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!
Grab my hand.
I can't kick!
I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!
No, you just have to save me. [Cartman stops and begins to drop down to the bottom, taking Kyle with him]
No! No I'm fine! [begins to walk with difficulty] I just need to get home, a-and rest.
[leaving] Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I... [stops] habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! [his pants rip open in the read and much of the treasure he had swallowed comes flying out of his body. Then he farts. A long silence follows as everyone looks at him and at the fake treasure he just pooped out]
It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!
That's right, and I... [looks at the tour guide] Fake treasure?
Noo... NOOO!! [craps out some more treasure] NOO! OW!
Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!! [craps out even more fake treasure] Dowww!
Eh! [a gold-colored vase pops out of his ass]
I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.
Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.
Well he called me chubby!
Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!
Sure you do. You're a great mom.
[grabs a can of Red Bull. Several more cans are scattered around, and one of them has tipped over and spilled some drink] Mom, I need another energy drink! [tosses a can away. Next shot, he's in the tub taking a bath and farts. Next shot, he has finished off the tacos his mom served him and takes one of hers without permission.]
[from his days supporting Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ: pounds the table a few times] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! [his hair gets meesed up from the impacts]
Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!
Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now. [burps]
Mom, I want a Twinkie.
[glances up at her] Ha! Hahahahahaha!
[mocking her British accent] No thanks, I'd rather naught.
The hell do you think you're doing?
Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!
Time out?
[glances down and thinks] And what exactly keeps me on the stool?
[looks at her, then hops off the stool] Whoa, how did I do that? [walks off to get his X-Box]
Ummm, no?
All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.
I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.
[hooks up the X-Box again] Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.
Because you took my Xbox.
Well, yeah.
Yeah. I guess so.
Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.
Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?
Why not?
You're sterile, is that it? [she releases him, taken aback by that question] No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it? [her jaw drops] Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.
Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! [Stella drops him and steps back a bit]
You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.
Not interested in me?
Yeah, well I don't see why-
Hey!
Mom, this guy doesn't-
Ah! Quit it!
Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-
KNOCK IT OFF!
I'm not fat!
Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?
Mom, this is degrading!
Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! [begins to strain the leash, but can't get loose. He struggles to escape]
Maaaa. Mommm. [getting hoarse] Mommm.
Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!
Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?
Mom!
[on the sofa to Liane's left] God dammit stop ignoring me!
This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!
Quit it, mom!
Ooo, Colonel?
Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.
Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!
Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!
[to Cesar] Goddammit, I am not a dog! [turns to Liane and hops up and down like an excited dog] Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken! [gets shrill] Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!
Gih- [quiets down] Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?
Suck my asshole, taco vendor!
Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me! [to Liane] Now hand it over!
You can't do that to me, I-
Goddamnit, you just can't-
Seriously! Ey? Eh... [he's now fully on his back, calm]
[sits up, then stands] Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken! [Liane ignores him by looking up and away] That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine! [goes upstairs] I hate you! I'm running away!
Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news. [sighs as Kyle takes his turn] I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow.
Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!
All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.
Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?! [Kenny takes his turn] His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people! [play continues] All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man.
Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere! [Butters takes his turn] Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! [walks out and shuts the front door]
Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.
You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.
[tries to answer, but can't, so he leaves in a huff] Goddammit! [knocks on another door and Craig answers] Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets.
...Should that really matter at a time like this?
This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.
All right, I'm back.
Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.
That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.
Aw, Goddammit!
What is he still doing here?!
What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!
Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! [gets off and walks to the phone]
Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!
I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-
Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-
Seriously! Mom-
Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?
Mom?!
Mom? Mom...
Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?! [despite his indignation, he looks compeled to follow orders. He gets up on the stool, gets the toothbrush, turns on the cold water, and gets the toothpaste] Jesus. What's happening to me?
Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.
She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.
Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.
She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?! [rushes away and gets an easel with some schematics on it] All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked. [the plan includes blaming Token for the murder] You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.
Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.
Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!
Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.
Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?! [the boys ignore him. He gets pissed off and walks away with the easel] Fine! I'll do it by myself!
You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son. [Liane moves a bit] You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore! [he moves the knife to a stabbing position] Goodbye, Mother. [about to deliver the fatal stab, he trembles for a few seconds, but his conscience gets a hold of him. Cartman relaxes a bit]
[shakes it off] No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!
She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.
Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...
[hops off the bed, dropping the knife and roll of paper as he heads for the door] Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me. [stops and vomits some pretty black stuff. Could be the evil in him]
Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean ham.
Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.
Tha... thank you?
'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. [the doorbell rings and Liane goes to answer the door]
I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. [waits a bit, then turns to go to his room. Liane turns around]
No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.
Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?
[as the dwarf, with mallet] Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?
Okay, I'm back.
Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!
Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!
Heheh, totally, heheh.
Yeah, come on, let's go! [the four now walk abreast] I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!
Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.
Get out of here, asshole!
Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?! [the ganker begins generating power] No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard! [the ganker shoots a fireball at Cartman] No! [the fireball hits and Cartman falls face down and dies.]
That sonofabitch!
He's a God damned butthole!
My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.
We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.
Clyde, Clyde! [moves around his podium to talk to Clyde more directly] If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it? [beat] I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?
When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?
All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30. [walks up to a map of their quest] We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!
Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!
Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.
All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.
The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.
This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth! [another dwarf walks in looking just like Cartman's dwarf] From with-
Butters? What the hell are you doing?
You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.
So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!
[turns around and leads] Then let's move out! [the others charge after him]
Everyone hold! [everyone stops in their tracks. The ganker turns around and faces them.]
Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click! [that sends the group charging at the ganker, who responds by summoning an army of giant scorpions] What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! [the actual rogue player is shown in his apartment, leaning back on his chair and playing without needing to think very much about what to do next. His character and scorpions decimate the group]
All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow! [Clyde's character looks like he's about to swing at a baseball] Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde! [Clyde is at his computer, but not participating in the game. He's looking at Playboy centerfolds.] Clyde! Clyde, you asshole! [rushes to join the others] Goddammit we lost Clyde!
Now, leave me alone, don't do- [the ganker electrocutes Cartman with his dagger through the mallet] that, dugh [Cartman dies, and the ganker skips away. Cartman screams into his mic, then throws down his headset] God-fucking-dammit!!! [meanwhile, in his apartment, the ganker just keeps plugging along.]
What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!
Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.
I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?
That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.
There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.
Yes. [whips out a sheet full of calculations] Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around, [firmly] or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters.
Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!
All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!
[begins to slur his speech ever so slightly, giving it a blasé feel] Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence.
Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?
Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks.
Don't worry, I have that covered. [pressed a button on a small intercom on his desk] Mom?
More Hot Pockets!
All right, everyone ready?
Let's go get him! [the battle begins. The rogue is playing with the right hand, eating a cookie with the left.]
Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.
Command-0. [sniffs]
Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.
Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.
Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?
Christ...
Everyone target scorpions.
Kyle! Fire spell!
Wait, we need Ben-Gay. [waddles to Kenny's desk desk and pulls out a tube of the stuff, then walks back and squirts some of it onto Kyle's right wrist, then rubs it in.]
I'm going as fast as I can!
All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh...
It's okay. [clicks on the intercom] Mom? Bathroom!
Bathroom! Bathroom! [clicks off. A second later Liane goes into the basement with a bedpan. Cartman sense this and lowers his pants as Liane positions the bedpan in place. Cartman lets go and a log comes out first, followed by a spattering stream of crap. Some of it ends up on the floor, some of it on Liane's blouse. Nasty.]
All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.
Kyle, cast arcane missile!
Stan, what the hell are you doing?! [the ganker runs and leaps toward Stan and Randy]
His shield and armor spells are down!
Looks like you're about to get pwned. [swings back and then pulls the mallet forward] Heeyeah! [the mallet smashed the ganker's head into little bloody pieces.]
Yes!
Yeah!
All right, yay.
We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.
What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.
Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots.
Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.
Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?
They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.
Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!
Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?
...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! [sees Butters walking towards the group]
Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?
Aha! Do you see?
I rest my case.
That's right, Butters.
What? People see the truth?
You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media! [begins to move away from the boys] I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! [goes around a corner and disappears]
It is wrong for me to ask questions?
[raises and waves his hand] Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!
[leaves his seat and goes to the front of the class with his laptop.] For Show and Tell today I have brought... [puts on some glasses] ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!.. [removes the glasses for dramatic effect] behind the 9/11 attacks! [the lights go out and a projector is turned on]
[his first image is that of the Twin Towers] We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers, [the image gets animated as a cross-section of a wall is picked apart and the steel girders shown, which led to their collapse.] which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel? [the other kids look at each other. Kyle's eyes are half-closed, showing his disinterest] We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well, [a picture of the Pentagon with the damage clearly visible. A helicopter hovers nearby] but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?
So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did? [he begins to use his fingers to show the numbers as he says them] Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. [click. Kyle now appears superimposed on the 9/11 picture already onscreen]. Kyle!
Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2! [clicks, and another shot of the Twin Towers is shown] When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur, [he zooms in on the picture, which just becomes pixilated] but when I computer-enhanced it, [the pixilation disappears as the picture sharpens - it's a drawing of an evil Kyle with a large, sharp knife in his right hand] You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.
And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, "Do you smell lemon grass?", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.
What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar!
Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!
[taunting and jabbing at him] I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!!
Aw Goddamnit!
[apologizes, but in a blasé fashion] I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish?
The hall monit- me?
[incredulous] Auth- authoritah?
Ahem. Me?
There's fear and darkness all around you
That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. [leaves. The video shoot resumes at school. Cartman is on the job when he turns around and sees someone else in the hall. He strikes a dramatic pose and yells] Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!
[shoves the boy into the lockers and whips out the Bear Spray] You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass!
[releases the boy] All right, cool, brah. Go with Christ. [turns right and walks away. The boy isn't quite finished]
[kicks the boy away] Argh!
[marches on] I am the Dawg, the big bad- [stops] Oh my God! [sees a wad of paper on the floor, runs up to pick it up and checks it out] What the fuck is this?!
[bursts into the classroom] Boyarrrgh! [everyone turns to see who it is. Cartman walks up to Ike] Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?!
I found this in the hallway. [unfolds the wad of paper - it's a drawing Ike made of his teacher with hearts all around her] Apparently your student Ike has a crush on you. [Ike looks around nervously] You got a crush on your teacher, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go with Christ. Here you go. [hands the drawing to the teacher and heads for the door]
Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway! [leaves and closes the door]
[bursts into the restroom. Butters is startled] Hands?! Let me see those hands!
[advances] Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah!
I knew it! [...slams his head against a toilet stall, then tosses him to the floor, cuffs him, and escorts him out of the restroom. Butters doesn't get a chance to pull his pants up. The hall pass remains on the sink where Butters left it.]
Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right?
Here, you need a smoke, brah?
You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.
Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah. [Butters coughs some more]
Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?
Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool.
What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.
Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.
Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.
They what??
[spins around] Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!
Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg!
Hall infraction! [runs up to Miss Stevenson]
You got a hall pass, brah?!
Yeah? Well, where's his hall pass?!
Get down on the floor!
[whips out the Bear Spray] You like bear mace, icehead?!
You're goin' with Christ! [sprays Miss Stevenson pretty good]
...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.
Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass.
I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.
You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch!
You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean. [points his index fingers at the camera]
Oh no!
I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense.
There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!
No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.
I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.
Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!

Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out! [they go forth]
Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!
[determined] Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton. We need to search it. Here's the hotel! [into the Intercom] Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here! [Beth just signals for Earl to drive into the hotel driveway and stop at the front doors. Earl pulls up and brakes quickly] All right, let's go! Move out! [they leave the SUV and rush into the hotel]
It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor! [they pass through the front entrance] Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty!
You seen this woman, brah? [shows her a picture of Miss Stevenson] She's staying here!
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Beth! Bear-mace that guy! [she sprays bear mace all over the concierge and he crumbles to the floor, trying to vomit] Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me!
I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!
[walks over to the second guest] Keep your mouth shut, brah!!
Praise Christ! Let's go! [the elderly man is convulsing from the effects of the bear mace.]
Bear mace that guy! And that guy! [Beth maces another bellboy and a guest as she and Cartman run by. Police officers round the corner and run after them]
Freeze, bitch!
It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor. [the officers are somewhat stunned] This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan.
Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!
[moves towards the camera] Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement.
That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. [walks towards the camera to turn it off.]
What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.
See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face. [starts imitating a hen's cluck]
I've done it lots of times.
[now on the stool facing the mirror, laughs a bit] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.
I am not!
[turns back to the mirror] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... [the door opens and Jimmy enters]
Oh my God. I crapped my pants. [feels his ass through his pants to be sure] You guys, I crapped my pants! [thinks, then leaves the bathroom] Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out!
Dude...
You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues
How do you know??
How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?
[under his breath] Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! [his mom arrives]
I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.
Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!
[yanks his hand away and runs back to the store] No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand.
Noo!! Nooo!!
How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!
Oh God... [shivers like someone in withdrawal] Okay, how long now?
[hopping out of his chair and running out] HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!
Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! [a store clerk notices and walks over]
Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?
Oh God!
Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!
You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.
I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.
[assertively] No. There is something I can do.
All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right? [turns around] I think I figured out how to do it.
Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.
It's simple science, Kyle.
I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!
I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself! [walks away in a huff]
[in the freezer] Ey!
Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!
[resisting all of Liane's efforts] No! No, it's too soon!
Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.
You're gonna help me freeze myself.
[stops and begins digging ] Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away. [finishes digging a hole, tosses the ice pick away, and prepares to step down into it] I have to be hidden. [removes his jacket and gives it to Butters] That's good. [begins to gather the snow around him and then faces Butters, who's shocked at this turn of events] And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!
No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea
All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?
All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed. [Butters looks at Cartman once more, then leaves. Butters turns to look at Cartman again] Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!
[all alone now] Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.
Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.
Where am I?
Safe where, butthole?!
[looks around] What??
Butters? Butters, you black asshole?! [suddenly looks tired.]
Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?
Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!
I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!
No... [looks up at the ceiling and] NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future. [puts his head in his hands and starts to weep. A door slides open and three of the aliens enter the room]
What?? [hops onto the desk] Really?? [jumps down and exults] YES!! YES!!
So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!
I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.
[strokes his chin and thinks] And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?
Who? [the medic is about to reply when something shakes the building they're in]
Who are they??
Jesus Christ!
I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.
What??
Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.
[goggles now above his eyes] We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin' to worry about. [the leader's ostrich makes a noise]
Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.
Over here! [runs over to it] Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this. [shatters the glass case protecting it and removes it]
Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans. [switches hands in holding the Wii, presses a button on his left glove and disappears]
I got it! I got the Wii!
[turns and leaves the transporter pad] Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side. [turns around as he reaches the door] Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call. [the door opens and Cartman walks into the hallway outside the room. The leader and his assistant look at each other]
[ruonds a corner] Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome! [almost walks into another UAA member] Get out of my way!
Here. [takes off the information crystal and hands it to him]
[...and enters an elevator] Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW! [the doors close]
Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!
There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!
You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-dammit! I am so fucking sick of the future! [starts throwing a tantrum, throwing things around]
I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!
Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood.
God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials! [switches channels. A picture appears briefly in which a reporter is about to mention an attack, but that vanishes. Three bored kids appear seated at a coffee table]
Tell me about it.
[now interested] What?
Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!
Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself. [walks forward a few steps] Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii.
I care! Where's the closest toy store??
Come on! Come on!
Ugh, finally!
I want one of those time-phone things.
Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people.
Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!
Look, I have to have one of those phones!
How about a robot? How much for the robot?
[turns around and walks away. K-10 follows] Science-dammit! [stops] Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records?
I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.
Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.
[steps inside] Come on in, Bob. [K-10 enters the room] All right, just let me use my tools... [pulls out a gun and fires at Boy 4, who is instantly trapped in a bubble, floating in the air. K-10 does the same to Boy 5.]
[walks up and takes the time phone from the coffee table] Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! [walks out the door with K-10]
Oh God! [throws himself back on the bed and squeezes his eyes shut. This time, the phone rings. He gets up to answer it. The caller is the Time Child] Hello? [he gets static until...]
Who is this?
What?? Who the hell is this?!
Me who?!
What?!
Oh very funny, Kyle!
Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.
Listen to this! [puts the phone to his ass and farts into it, then slams the phone down on its base] Dickhead. [the phone rings again. Cartman picks it up and quickly slams it down again.]
Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!
Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!
What?? [enters the kitchen to talk to his future self] Who the fuck is this?!
Suck my balls!
...Okay, you have one minute.
[shocked] Are you spying on me?!
Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself! [hangs up and pulls his hood back over his head] Come on, Butters, we're going!
This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!
What is the Great Question?
I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!
Who?
Garrison? But he's an asshole.
It's an emergency! It's an emergency!
I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!
Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!
Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison! [Cartman's present changes again, and now he's wearing a gray suit with orange cape. Also, he's back at UAL headquarters, which is quiet and undamaged]
[turns around] Go... Right... Where am I going? [he was facing a panel of UAL and UAA members]
Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism?
So there is no war now in the future.
[wondering] And what was that purpose again?
Right... [a bird flies in and sets down next to him.]
I'll miss you too, COCKA-3.
Noooo! [his future self is beamed into his body and he checks himself] I'm back. Wow! I'm back!
Mom! Mom, they did it!
[happy, for once] No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.
What? NO! [runs up to the window and sees that his mom is right] NOO!! [turns around and moves away from the storefront] You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over!
I can't wait two months! [runs back to the doors] I can't! There has to be a way around this!
Hello?
...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle! [hangs up and leaves the store.]
Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.
Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token. [points at the camera. Dramatic music swells. The camera then looks at Token, who's putting some books into his locker] He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.
Ohhhhhhhh?
Oh shit here we go! [gets really excited and cuts in between them, yelling] It's on! Race war! [goes back and yells at one end of the hall] Race war! Race war! [comes back again and yells at the other end of the hall] Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! [returns, just itching to see Stan and Token fight]
[softly] Yeah, come on! Here we go!
[softly] Race war! Come on! Race war!
Token forfeits! [takes Stan's left hand and holds it up in victory] Whites win! [lets go and twirls away] Whites win! [runs to one end of the hall] Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!
No! Dude! No fucking way! [laughs] Dude! [resumes laughing]
[shakes his head back and forth, then rears back, laughing all the while] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha...
Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. [resumes laughing. Mr. Nelson gets pissed off, but holds it in]
[stops long enough to respond] Oh. Did I hurt its little feelings? [resumes laughing]
[before Mr. Nelson finishes talking] Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! [stomps his foot on the floor, points to Mr. Nelson, and laughs. Principal Victoria buries her face in her hands]
[stops] Barely! [starts up again]
[stops] "Rise above it!" Get it? [starts up again]
Look, look how its face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!
Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?! [walks up to Kyle accusingly] Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?! [Mr. Nelson walks out towards the entrance, then curves around to stand behind Cartman] I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!
Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed it up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!
It's a midget, dude.
Hahaha, no- no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. [the kids urge them to fight, and the match begins]
Say "Uncle!"
Hahaha, now say "Carol Anne, don't go into the light!"
Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical! [Mr. Nelson rises and pummels him in the back of the head. Cartman falls forward] Oh!
This picture I like to call "The Pierre". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha. [the caption reads "THE PIERRE 3/10/07." Cartman flips the page. The pages are artsy in design] And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth. [Yep, the tampon is in there like a thermometer] I call this picture "The Sleeping Menstrual". [the caption is shown, Cartman flips the page. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny stand around him, looking at the pictures. They're all in Cartman's room.] This one, I call "Hot Fudge Mondae". [caresses the picture] I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.
Oh no, there's much more. [flips the page] Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it "New Moon Rising". [a shot of Cartman hanging his ass over Butters' face] I did a whole study using my ass. [Cartman's ass over Butters' face from the left side] Here it is using some high-contrast stuff. [next, Cartman wearing darker pajamas, mooning Butters] trying out some... different light filters here. [last shot looks faded, with Cartman's ass directly on Butters' face.] But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.
Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-
Heh! [quickly puts away his scrapbook] Oh, oh hey, Butters! [turns around and greets him] I wasn't expecting you so soon.
[returns] No no, these guys were just leaving. [faces the other guys menacingly] weren't you guys?
Kyyyle!
What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.
[off screen] You guys! I got it! [runs in and joins them] It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!
It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! [cracks up at his own cleverness]
I know I know, check it out, look. [the other three crowd in and look at the picture] I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!
Because that makes Butters gay now!
Eh- ...what?
[looks more closely at the picture] Nuh uh.
Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?
But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!
No, no, it was a stupid mistake!
No, it was just for a second! [seeing that his plan has backfired, he puts the picture away] What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?
How?
[low voice] Really?
[beat] ...Shit, I gotta find Butters! [runs off]
[enters the room] Butters.
Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.
It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be so stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
You ready?
Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!
Hang on a second here. [makes sure the blindfold is on snugly]
'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? [rushes off to get the toybox]
[under his breath] All right, that's good. [undoes his pants] Okay, open your mouth, Butters? [lowers them and ...] That's good, just like that.
...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. [lifts up his shirt to show his massive gut]
All right, you ready? [grabs Butters' head and draws it closer to his own wiener] All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. [at that moment the door opens and Stephen enters.]
Uh! [quickly gets dressed up]
Haahaahahaha! [crosses his arms] Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!
[uncrosses his arms] I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!
[crosses his arms again as he turns away] That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. [pleased with himself]
Right, except for you.
[turns around] Why would you tell anybody?
...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.
Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch. [grins, but Stan and Kyle ignore him] Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! [chuckles]
[angrily] Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!
Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys! [the other boys continue playing. Cartman changes tactics: he pleads] You guys, please don't tell anybody.
Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle. [turns around and cackles] Haha, hahahaha! [leaves the house]
Where is it, you filthy Jew?!
[grabs Kyle by the collar and shakes him violently] You know God damned well what!
I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone! [shakes Kyle again] What did you do with my picture?!
[rolls up his sleeves] Give it back, Kyle!
I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now, [puts up his fists as if to box] I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here.
You shut up! You're lying, and [points an accusing finger at Stan and Kenny] you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews! [Kyle punches him on the right arm once, firmly] OW! [puts his left hand over his right arm] OW! AAAAUH! [grimaces, turns around, and runs out of the park] NYAAAAAAAAAA!
Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski.
It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!
[long pause] Why... why does that matter?
All right. It's a picture ...of me.
It's a picture ...of me. [long pause] And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.
No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... put their penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!
Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep.
I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!
That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now. [pounds his desk and gets determined] That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth. [grabs his ears and starts twisting them until they hurt] Ow. OW. OW!
[crying throughout] I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.
Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.
Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.
[sniffles] Last time, when Butters stayed the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.
But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay. [turns his face to the wall and cries again]
[looks at her and sobs] But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. [turns to her and cries into her chest]
You, you will?
It is? [happily jumps off his chair and runs to her] Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! [hugs her]
[his smile vanishes] What?
Mom, she's lying!
Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!
[thinks a moment] Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final laugh.
Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone? [Kyle turns around and Cartman is in his face. Cartman softly says] Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!
HA! [gets up and goes to the board, pulls down the projector screen and clears his throat.] For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer. [clicks the projector on, and the class lights dim] This first picture I like to call "Moods of Winter" [a shot of snow-covered barren trees], a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?
And now this next picture [clears his throat. Quick cut to]
And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. [everyone gasps]
Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-
[longer pause] ...Lame.
Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem. [points to Kyle, but blocks Kyle's view of his left hand with his right.] Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.
Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
[answering] They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. [Butters gasps]
This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.
Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?
Well who was it? [points to Kenny] It was Kenny, right?
Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who! [points to Kenny again] It was Kenny, wasn't it?
[pounds on his desk] That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!
All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! [Opposite Cartman are Jimmy, Tweek, Clyde, Anne, Bebe, Red. and two other kids. With Cartman are Craig, Token, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Kevin, Butters, and Wendy]
Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!
Me?!
I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!
That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. [Stan is stunned]
And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! [Kenny makes an angry face]
There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! [turns left and walks away. Clyde looks around]
All right, lock that door, Craig! [Craig goes to lock the door]
I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice. [whips out a little propane torch from his right pocket] We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties. [whips out a lighter from his left pocket, strikes the lighter on, and uses the lighter to light the torch. He puts the lighter away. Clyde is scared now.] Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.
[figuring out how to respond] This is a scientific test, designed to-
I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!
Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
All right, now everyone back over there! [the boys head back to the bench] We'll start with what I already know. [moves the heated coil tip over the blood sample. Only steam comes from it]
Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle! [takes Kyle's Petri dish and ...the same thing happens] Huh, I guess you're clean. [tries another Petri dish]
It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! [sticks the tip into the Petri dish, causing the blood to heat up and jump out of the dish. He gets the blood all over himself, and for good measure, tosses the rest of the blood onto himself.]
Kenny!
Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! [silence for a second or two, then Kenny bolts for the door, pushing Craig aside, opening the door, and running down the hall]
He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen. [beat] Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! [they turn and head off]
What, Clyde?
All right, see you there! [the guys turn around and leave] Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!
Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!
Guilty! I thought so! [the boys pull down his hood and coat, and his shirt]
All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! [the boys gang up on Kenny and give him the sock bath]
Oh I get it. [walks up to Stan and Kyle] This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!
Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!
But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! [the other boys join in the chant "Sock bath!" and gang up on Kenny once again]
Uh oh! [Kyle's seat is empty, and he fears the worst]
Duhude, dude, [throws out his arms, palms out] not cool!
Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.
What's wrong? [looks at Baahir, who's looking back at him, then looks back at Mrs. Garrison and takes her aside] Has he been checked for bombs?
No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.
[hushed] Kyle, are you on your computer?
Get online. I need you to check something for me.
Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!
Get online now!
Go to MySpace. [enters the school building] See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.
[begins walking down the hallway] Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?
[walks further along] Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?
[stops suddenly] That's funny.
He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.
[voiceover] The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.
[entering the boys' restroom, still in hushed tones] Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! [checks the toilet stalls on all fours]
I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?
Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.
[exits the building through a side door and answers the call] Yeah. [walks among various trash cans and bins]
Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion. [starts running] Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!
Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
[stops] What?
Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!
He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
I said I will only talk to the President!
LALALALALALALALA!
LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?
Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!
Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!
Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?
Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?
It's my balls! [laughs as Kyle just looks at the image]
[his laugh dies down, then] Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.
[gets the call] Yeah? [walks through a parking lot]
Yes, Mr. Thompson?
Why? Did you find something?
[stops] A snuke?
[walks again] I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?
Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. [the framing for the two scenes is removed to reveal the one image of Cartman standing next to the CIA agents. They look at each other]
Big surprise!
Let me have time with him.
We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him! [removes his cap and goes in] You will tell me where your son is!
[farts] Where is the detonator?!
[farts some more, and again, and again] I can do this aaall day.
You can make it stop!
Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!
[whips around and shows them the syringe] Do you know what this is?! [they look at each other, unsure] This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. [injects himself with the syringe into the right arm and hops up on the stool next to Mrs. Hakeem]
Where is your son?!
Answer it! [holds the phone to Mrs. Hakeem's right ear]
Butters.
We got him! I know where he is!
No no, he's my lead. [opens the suitcase]
You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! [gives himself a double injection of apple juice]
Uuugh! [lies motionless for a few seconds, then gets up]
[walks up to Baahir and grabs him by the collar] Where is the detonator!
You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!
Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! [A black van pulls up next to them and the side door slides open. Three real terrorists jump out and aim their semiautomatics at the two boys]
Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.
Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.
Uhh yes, of course?
The Russians?
The Germans?
The Germans again?
You can't possible mean...?
Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.
Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.
But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.
Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!
Yes or no, Kyle?!
But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? [Baahir's parents approach, looking around at all the activity in front of their house]
Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh? [raises his own hand] That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.
And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!
Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!
Bye, Easter bunny! [leaves]
Have you lost your mind?
You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.
No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?
[holds his arms out in open embrace] Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read [whips out the book from his back pocket] "The Old Man and the Sea" for us. Comprende? "The Old Mand Y La Mer".
Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.
Okay, gracias.
Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.
They'll be done. [whistles to get the laborers' attention.] ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? [the laborers approach] All right, did you read the book?
All right, did you write the four essays?
Okay, let's have 'em.
Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!
Crap! [the boys head for their seats]
Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.
That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!
All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.
[pinches his nose shut] Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house. [releases the pinch] Get out of here!
No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.
Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.
Thank you, thank you. [to Stan and Kenny] The ramp ready?
All right, here we go! Jimmy? [Jimmy starts the drum roll. Cartman takes off and picks up speed on his way to the ramp. Tweek and Bebe have their fists ready to pump for him. He leaves the ramp successfully, only to land on the bum and hit the ground without injury]
[jumps off his skateboard] Yes! I did it! [tosses his helmet away] I jumped over the homeless! [turns around] Yes!
There's a bunch outside my house too.
No! Fuck off! [slams the door shut]
Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
You what?!
[makes his way to Kyle] Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!
You see what you did, Kyle?!
They're everywhere!
[pinching his nose shut with his left hand as he fans the smell away with his right] Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.
Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.
All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.
I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.
I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
Cool.
Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.
Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
Youu heard about that?
Thirty was hard enough.
Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.
Let's hope to Christ this works. [prepares to press the red button. Music begins to play]
Is nice to the homeless
City of Santa Monica
[to Stan] They're listening. Let's go! [a Destination Marquee is shown. Stan flips switch C on and presses a green button. The marquee changes from Denver to California]
Marina del Rey
California
Californiania
City of Venice
[jumps off his skateboard, throws down his helmet and exults] Yes! That's three homeless! Suck on that! Fuck yeah! [faces his friends and the bums]
[picks out a figure] Big Ring Slammer. Comes with posable neck-smash grip. [moves the package around with his left hand and strokes his chin with his right] That's pretty kewl. Let's see...
[puts the Slammer back on the rack and selects another figure.] The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-
[turns around and walks off, saying softly] Dude, that mom is kewl. [he arrives at the checkout line with his action figure]
[turns around and glares at Thomas] Are you talkin' to me?!
What's your problem, kid?!
What?
[waves his arms around] Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?
[turns around and faces the crowd] All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?
Twinkle in my eye. [turns and heads for the entrance] haha. HahaHAAhahahaha. [throws his action figure into the air and runs out the door]
I don't need the toy! I've found something better! [dances away] 'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!
Puh- pussy!
Pussy! Cock! Shit! [covers his mouth in faking embarrassment]
Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! [covers his mouth immediately]
...Cocksucker!
Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!
But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say.
Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! [gives him a mischievous look]
Shit! Butthole! [walks up to Wendy] Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry. [smiles and moves on] Titties! Cock! [he's relishing this. He points to a redhead] Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!
Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!
[deciding to explain things. Mr. Mackey is in the background] Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole! [the other kids lean away] Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.
[his thunder is stolen and he covers for it] Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle? [walks to Kyle] Asscheeks! [hauls Kyle off to a clearing] Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.
...Oh, okay, you figured me out. [claps] Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble.
Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.
Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! [Mr. Mackey does nothing but walk away]
Dicktits!
Shit! Asshole! [Mrs. Garrison looks at Cartman with a bit of shock, then turns to the board.] 'Scuse me. [Cartman smiles]
Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch! [the class laughs. Cartman pretends to be hurt] You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.
Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!
Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.
Kyle please! I'm sorry!
That's right, Kyle. [turns his head to the left, where Kyle happens to be] Crap-filled vagina!
Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.
You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?
Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother. [looks at Gerald and Sheila] Fat Jew! Jew bitch!
Thank you. Big-nosed kike! [Sheila laughs nervously]
Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face! [thumps his chest and clears his throat] Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one. [starts to walk away] Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works. [stops to whisper to Thomas] Isn't having Tourette's awesome? [leaves]
[doing a voice-over]
[adding to the commercial] Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true. [jumps at the camera] Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! [jumps back in shock, covers his mouth, then smiles at the camera sweetly, bending his head to the right]
Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!
[serves himself some liquid] Yes. It's all finally come to fruition. [gently swirls the ice around] The final cog in my... master plan. [turns around to face Kyle] This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air. [turns back and prepares a drink for Kyle] Despicable things. And people will call me brave.
[takes the drink to Kyle] Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?
[quickly gives him the drink in triumph] Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.
Then the game is on, Kyle.
[walks back to make another "Scotch"] Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? "Big titties! Buttmunch!" There's no walls anymore! "Shit!" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. "I wet my bed last night." [realizes what just happened]
Uhh nuh-nothing...
Hm. That was... weird.
[Mr. Donaldson adjusts the mic to his height] Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls! [applause rises from the crowd] You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. [applause rises from the crowd]
And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up! [startled by his own words, then covers his mouth as the crowd falls silent.] Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad. [turns away from the mic and mumbles] What the hell is going on?
No hey ut what, what I meant to say was "asslicker cumballs." And uhh, [helplessly] I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! [covers his mouth]
[clambors offstage] Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! [runs through the crowd]
[finishes up and looks at Butters] Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?
Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners. [he covers his mouth in horror as Butters is stunned] Wah! [faces Butters]
I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! [runs out of the restroom]
Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!
[turns around and faces her] No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's [struggles to keep control] AAAA no, NAAAA! [he's got the crowd's attention] I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year. [now composed] Ah, I need to be going now.
[apprehensive] Dateline. Right. [backs away but can't control his statements] I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! [runs out the door with his hands firmly over his mouth]
[rushes onto the set] Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.
My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.
No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.
[heads for the door] But I'm not gonna do the-
I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?
You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.
No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad. [gets his cap and puts it on] So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. [hops off the stool and walks away]
Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!
[begins backing up] No, I'm just gonna go- [wonders how this is happening]
[gets back on the stool and whispers to himself] How does he do that?
Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this? [walks to a nearby table and begins to pray] God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like "I touched penises with my cousin!" [covers his mouth quickly] Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.
Kyle?
Kyle, what are you doing?
Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!
I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!
You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say! [heads up the aisle and out of the studio] I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! [Kyle is alone on set, but Thomas comes up and stands next to him]
All right, let's try over here. [points straight ahead. Jason appears behind them] Set up traps there, and there as well. [points right] Last time I saw him he ran right through here. [moves, revealing Stan further back. Cartman moves to his left, and Kyle is seen sitting on a fallen tree]
[sets up a trip wire between two stones] It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now. [drops the rope, walks forward, and whips out a walkie-talkie] Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?
Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. [Tweek joins Stan in the background]
O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?! [whips out his walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?
Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! [puts away the walkie talkie and gets back to setting the trip wire.]
Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. [finishes setting the trip wire]
[whispers loudly] Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet? [whips out the walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!
Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
[to Token] Set off diversion track C! [Token sets off a small bomb under a pile of leaves. Nearby a leprechaun skips into view, then stops upon seeing the boys]
[charging forth] Get it! [the leprechaun runs away, and all the boys except Kyle, who is dumbfounded, give chase] Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! [the leprechaun crawls under a tree trunk and gets up. He trips over a rope and a net descends on him; he dodges it and runs off. He runs into a bush and trips a sliding door, which drops down behind him. It traps him in a cage. He looks around for a way out, but sees the boys crowd in.]
[making his way through, out of breath] Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!
[gets out a Bowie knife] Tell me where the gold is or you die! [unsheathes it] Slow! [the leprechaun makes a rainbow with his right hand, and it teleports him out and disappears]
[walks up to Kyle and clears his throat] Kyle, suck my balls. [brings out the contract both of them signed. Kyle stands motionless]
[walks in with the contract and a camera] Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?
Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.
Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.
We had a deal, Kyle!
[walks up to Kyle] You signed an agreement, Kyle!!
Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.
And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!
[as the plaintiff, with a lawyer] I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt. [Kyle is the defendant, without a laywer] A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls! [the judge can't believe what she's hearing] I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!
[pumps his left fist] Yesss!
Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.
Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.
He has to. He's been ordered by the court.
What? Move aside, move aside! [moves through the crowd to the door]
Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.
Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! [the sound of helicopters ruins the moment as Cartman's smile vanishes and he looks around. Stan and Kyle turn around and see the helicopters. Police cars and government vehicles converge on Cartman's house as the copters land. General Deckter, specialist, two soldiers, and two security guards pour out of the helicopter]
[runs up and grabs Kyle's free hand] Hey, let go of him! [Kyle is now in a tug of war between Cartman and General Deckter]
No! No, he has to suck my balls! [loses his hold on Kyle and falls to the sidewalk on all fours. He gets up and runs after the helicopter, which takes off quickly. All the other vehicles pull out. Cartman runs down the street a bit] NO! KYYYYLE! [loses his turban]
Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.
I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice... [looks at a picture of Kyle] is the justice you take. [to the picture] Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. [runs his finger over Kyle's mouth]
[voiceover] Previously on Battlestar Galactica [clips from last week's episode follow]
[voiceover] Every night, the dream is the same. [a field of grain pops up with purple mountains in the background. Cartman walks in smiling and holding the contract] I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls. [Kyle is standing in the field, and Cartman walks up to him] And it turns out I was right. "Time to pay up, Kyle." [Kyle's name echoes into the distance] But then... [Kyle turns around with his mouth sewn shut] "NO! NOOO!" [Cartman rises into the air and the field fades to black] It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. [he floats through the darkness. His right testicle pops and dissolves into the air. His left one does the same, and there's no penis left either.]
NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.
Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!
Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!
[gets up quickly and marches towards Kyle] Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!
That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!
[some guards seize him and begin to drag him away] No! Hold on a second! [they stop and let him go] I have a contract [holds it out] validated by the United States court system!
Theee conference room is which way? [smiles]
Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.
Well we're here now, that's all that matters. [brings up a small cup of mixed nuts] Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.
[cuts him off with a loud yawn and hops off his chair] Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle. [walks towards a tripod and sets a camera on it] It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.
Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle. [starts unzipping a duffle bag] I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. [pulls out a purple robe]
[puts on the robe] Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do. [pulls out a crown and turns to face Kyle] By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are... [puts on the crown] extra vinegary...
I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?
No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus. [sets the depth] There we go. [smiles, then returns to his seat] Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?
In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- [a red alert interrupts him]
Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.
No! Goddammit no!
No! Kyle can't die. [gets on his knees and checks various parts of his body for a pulse]
Kyle?
[enraged] NNNOOO! [begins giving Kyle CPR] No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!
[to the paramedic] Zap him again! [opens Kyle's coat and shirt for better contact] Do it!
DO IT! [the paramedic places the paddles back on Kyle's body] Come on buddy.
Come on buddy. [the paramedic fires away. Kyle rises, then falls softly. No sign of life yet.] Get out of here! [goes back to giving Kyle CPR. A woman covers her eyes in despair] Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight! [smacks Kyle around] Fight! Fight! Right now! [begins to break down] Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight! [pounds Kyle's chest hard] Fight! [Kyle coughs, then comes to. Cartman begins to weep happily.] Give him some air. [an oxygen mask appears and Cartman places it over Kyle's nose and mouth.] There, easy. Breathe easy. [weeps softly some more]
Wake up, Kyle. [Kyle wakes up to a smiling Cartman]
[comes in smiling with a covered platter on a food cart] Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?
What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.
[smiles] You just rest, Kyle. [takes the lid off the platter] Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry- [suddenly pondering] but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle? [taps his chin] What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream, [real softly] let's see
Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle? [turns towards the sundae] What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right! [faces Kyle with a determined face] My balls!
Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now. [takes off his cap and begins to pull out yet another costume] So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?
[now in papal robes] Don't try to change the subject, Kyle. [puts on the papal tiara and pulls the camera and its tripod into place] You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. [closes his eyes and smiles]
Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split
How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
...What?
Where are you going?!
Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.
[follows him out and watches him walk away] We had a DEAL KYLE!
IT ISN'T OVER!! [Kyle turns to face him] It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!
[gets up] What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!
You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?
Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?
[two guards haul him away] No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!
Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!
Kyle?
So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. [gloats]
You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality. [he begins to think hard, and an imaginary version of himself appears, wearing the crown and robe from before.] Why look, it's me. And... [thinks again, and an imaginary Kyle appears] And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? [the imaginary Kyle drops out of view]
O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! [the imaginary Cartman is a little shocked]
O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?
No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.
Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. [everyone but Kyle laughs]
Stan, you guys are good! [Stan and Kyle more their right arms around during a power chord, then quickly return to playing. The score is 15,594 points and climbs quickly. Randy watches from the kitchen doorway]
Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.
Real guitars are for old people.
[so relaxed his fat blocks his chin from view] Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!
Oh my God this is so awesome.
All right, Stan, you've got it, man!
Come on guys. Let's get out of here. [the boys leave, as to the couples and other spectators, leaving Stan alone with Mr. Kincade. Mr. Hart approaches Mr. Kincade.]
Stop cheating, Craig! [pushes Craig from behind]
'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!
What?
Butters, you wanna play me next? [picks up Stan's controller and puts it on]
[mad] They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?
[with a double cheeseburger in his left hand] Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.
Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!
No, because chicks know I'm not fat, I'm buff! They probably put you at the bottom of the list 'cause you have fucked-up teeth! Or Kenny 'cause he's poor.
Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna eat Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.
All right, Bebe, let's see the list.
You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!
Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him?
Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can out think them.
All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right? She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her. [points to a chalkboard with his plan on it] This is what I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail". [a map with routes of the plan laid out]
At 1 PM tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here. [upper center part of the map] When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.
Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?
Bail, bail! [he and Kenny take off]
Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.
Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time". When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! [continues]
We got it! We got it! [next shot is of Stan at his locker as Craig runs by]
Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! [Kyle is washing his hands, but he turns to see what's going on]
What?! That's bullcrap! [Kenny moves up past Cartman and looks for his name. He finds himself at #7]
You're last, dude! [laughs heartily]
Yes way! Check it out! [laughs heartily]
So? I'm hotter than Kyle. [makes his way through the crowd and out of the bathroom] I'm better looking than Kyyyle! [the other boys join him out except for Stan and Kyle] Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!
I'm better looking than you! [knocks on the window again] The girls think I'm better looking than you, Kyle! [Kyle sighs, stands on his bed, and pulls on a drawstring to close the curtains. Cartman moves with the curtain until he can no longer see inside Kyle's room] Dude, Kyle! Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are! [knocks] Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive! [knocks again. The curtain is fully closed and Kyle goes back to sleep] Kyle?
[walks up] Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right? [Kyle stays mum, as before] Cool. [walks away. A few seconds later, Kyle's eyes pop open]
AHHHHHH.
What?
No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!
No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!
...Ice cream?
Well...you did say free ice cream? [Dentist and Liane laugh]
[Opening his eyes, blinking a lot] Uh. It's over?
[Eyes fully open, sitting up] Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!
All right, so where's my ice cream?
You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!
What's that supposed to mean?!
I HAVE AIDS?
"SORRY"?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE "SORRY"?!
Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!
No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!
[Knocks the ice cream on the ground] Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!
NO! NOOOOOOOO!
God damn it, this sucks ass!
Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!
Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!
Where the hell is everybody? [a waitress arrives with some food]
So this is it?
Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!
Just bring out Elton John already!
Jimmy Buffett?!
Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
[sticks his middle finger up in the air] Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!
Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!
Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.
Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.
...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead. [Kyle bursts out laughing; Cartman angrily approaches him] Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!
No you don't!
If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face! [the smirk is having trouble not breaking into a laugh] Well any God damned second, Kyle!
[watched Kyle leave] Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!
Ironic how?
[spins around and gets in Stan's face] Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!
[advances] Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!
[comes into view also dressed as a cat burglar] All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. [they head towards the sliding door]
Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.
Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.
I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.
[gets down to business] All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.
Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times. [moments later, Cartman is shown moving up along the outer wall to Kyle's window. He stops and opens the window gingerly, silently steps onto Kyle's bed, and walks over to Kyle's face. Then he whispers] You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well... [reaches into his back pack, pulls out a syringe, rolls up the sleeves on his left arm and...] let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. [...draws some blood into it and drops the blood into Kyle's mouth. Kyle instinctively tastes it and swallows it. Cartman quickly goes back out the window and slams it shut as Kyle wakes up.]
Pass me the ball! [Kyle runs in from a distance...] Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole! [...and shoves Cartman forward at full speed. Cartman falls on his face, then looks back at Kyle.] Kyle, what the F?!
Kyle, what?!
Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?
Nothing!
Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. [too late. Butters stops motioning]
Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
Kyle!
Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
[grudgingly] Kind of.
[grudgingly] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.
See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. [they are shown the door]
[keeping pace with Kyle] Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now? [stops] Kyle, where are you going?
What's that supposed to mean? Kyle? [settles on the obvious] Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!
Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole! [Kyle enters Cartman's room and begins breaking anything he sees. First, a toy rocket. Then, he grabs a poster of Braveheart from the wall and rips it apart. Next, he grabs the Wellington Bear Magic Mic and smashes it on the floor. Cartman walks in.] What the fuck are you doing?! [picks up some of his broken toys. Kyle knocks over a box of small toys] Kyle, stop it! [Kyle breaks apart a toy Mountie after three tries] God damn it, don't! [Kyle walks over to Cartman's big toy box, grabs Clyde Frog,..] Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone! [...and rips its head right off and moves off.] NO!! [Cartman picks up the two halves of his plush frog as Kyle moves to the XBOX] AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle! [Kyle picks it up and tries to pull it out of the power socket] Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND! [stops Kyle before Kyle gets to smash the XBOX on the floor] I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!
No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.
Break my Xbox and you'll never know.
NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.
He was a basketball player.
So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy. [grabs Kyle's shoulder] You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!
[stunned] My God...
We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.
Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.
Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!
We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! [turns around and leaves Kyle standing there]
Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.
Yeah, well, at least [leans into the aisle and looks back at the other passengers] it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.
No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here! [the flight attendant turns and walks away] We're on our way, buddy. [puts his left hand on Kyle's right hand] Magic Johnson, here we come.
[removes his hand from Kyle's and places his hands together over his stomach] I know. I'm scared too.
We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
Kyle, we need to try to find a-
[thinks for a few seconds] I don't think it's funny, Kyle.
[clears his throat] Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-
[waits a second] Are you sure?
[waits a second] Are you HIV-positive? [Kyle smacks him] Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!
Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.
All right!
[grin vanishing] What?! Aw, no!
What?! Aw, God damn it! [puts his arm around Kyle] Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.
What? No. No. [runs after him] Kyle, no!
Yeah, but we totally don't.
Aw dude, that's our town!
That's enough to buy slaves!
[runs off] Sweet!
We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! [the boys make it through the crowd and approach a set of stairs. A security guard stops them]
[aims his camera] All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'.
Cat pee? [Kenny lets up and then tries to choke himself again]
All right, this should keep my cat in place while he sprays the urine. [Mr. Kitty meows] Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? [Mr. Kitty meows]
Okay, ready Kenny?
All right, bring out...! The other male cat. [Kyle walks to a pet carrier, opens the door, pulls out a brown striped cat, and places it on the coffee table opposite Mr. Kitty. The two cats meow at each other first, then growl at each other. After a short while, Mr. Kitty shoots concentrated piss into Kenny's face]
Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? [Kenny's not responding. His mind is elsewhere...]
[through Kenny's hallucination] Kenny! Kenny, wake up! [In the middle of town, Cartman is stopping Kenny from disrobing any further] Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!
Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.
Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?
Ah, Kenny! [Stan and Kyle come up to restrain Kenny]
Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off. [the agents soon leave, and Cartman walks up to the dim attic with a small book] Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now. [drops the book in front of the cat] Here. Write a diary.
Yeah, who has cats these days? [laughs nervously]
[sits up] Mr. Kitty, shhh! [Mr. Kitty meows a 3rd time] Damn it! [gets up and leaves the bed. A small door to the attic opens and Cartman pops in with a candle. Mr. Kitty is nearby] Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you. [Mr. Kitty goes to a window and meows. Cartman follows him to the window] What?! [looks out a half-moon window and sees a cat, it meows] It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet. [Mr. Kitty meows] No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself. [Mr. Kitty meows] I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty. [crosses his arms] I'm in trouble enough as it is. [Mr. Kitty paws at Cartman] All right, all right, fine. [heads to the attic door and goes downstairs, closing the door behind him]
[whispers and motions] All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly. [two kittens walk up next to Rufus] Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all. [they all look at him sadly, one of them meows] I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to- [the cats lower their head further while focusing on Cartman, Cartman starts to have tears in his eyes] Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. [turns and leaves]
Who is it?!
[quickly looks both ways] Hiding cats? [nervously] Why, that would be illegal. [backs into the living room]
Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.
I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can- [his weakness comes through as the cat gazes at him] Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...
What the hell? [Kenny has somehow found the cats and is squeezing them to get cheesed. His face and parka are covered with concentrated piss. He grabs another cat and cheeses some more] Kenny, get out of here!
Aw, crap- Kenny! [Cartman begins to follow him down, but stops temporarily] Bad. Kitties.
He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.
They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! [crosses his arms and looks away. Stan opens his mouth in shock, Kyle looks angrily at Cartman]
But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. [Kyle stops]
[strokes his chin] Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.
Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.
Oh God, I'm bored already.
Gayness! [everyone laughs and looks at Ike, who looks chagrined.]
We don't care. *urp*
God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!
[jumps off the couch and runs to the TV] No! NOOO!
How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
[steps up] Wait. I've got it.
There's more people viewing it!
Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.
Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!
Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.
Sweet. I think we're next in line now.
...You are a homo, Butters.
[raises his hand] Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.
Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!
[now on his desk and stretching that left arm up higher] Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal.
Yes! [walks up next to Garrison's desk]
[turns to the board and walks up to it. He grabs the wooden pointer and smacks it softly against his left palm] Well well well. Who's teacher now? [whips it against the floor] Yeahhh. Who's teacher?!
That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended! [whips the pointer against the floor] Yeahhh. [whips the pointer against the floor again] Mmm yeah, you like that? [Kyle just rolls his eyes] All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here! [whips the pointer against the floor again] Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. [waves the pointer around a little and follows it with his eyes.]
Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!
[at ease] Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.
That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?
Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.
Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.
Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?
Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.
[dressed as Jaime Escalante] Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez. [holds up his left thumb] Your new teacher.
I am here... to teach you calculuuus.
Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.
Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
How do I reach these keeds? [faces the class, his left hand tucked under the left pant pocket] The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time. [holds up a picture] This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.
No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.
Go ahead, the door's right there. [turns left] Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu. [the boy walks to the door and leaves. Cartman turns away from the class and sighs, dropping the photo] How do I reach these keeds?
Nice form, compadre. [walks towards the basket with the ball]
Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game? [whistles] Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? [a scoreboard is shown, and a boy on the platform looks over at him]
[gets into position] Okay, you start on defense, amigo. [dribbles the ball for a few seconds, then whacks the boy on the right shin with a collapsible pointer]
Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!
What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn. [the boy is on offense. He dribbles for a few seconds and moves to the basket, but Cartman again takes out his pointer and whacks the boy's left shin. The boy falls again, and Cartman steals the ball and scores again. The boy at the scoreboard updates the score: 2-0 Visitors] That's two to nothing, amigoo. [his opponent stands up]
Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. [throws the ball back at the boy]
Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing! [sighs] How do I reach these keeds?
Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time. [hops onto a box so he could write on the chalkboard. He draws a video camera aimed at a box marked D] When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- [the errant student returns]
Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack. [the student takes his seat] All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: "I mis-interpreted the rules." It's what you must also say when caught cheating! "I mis-interpreted the rules." Say it with me.
Good. Again.
Again!
Now you sound like white people!
The answer to #27 is 5.
The answer to #28 is 14.
All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back. [leaves the classroom and looks around for the girl] Melita! Melita, hold on. [walks up to her] You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?
[sighs] How do I reach these keeds? [turns around and faces her] All right, let's go get you an abortion.
Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself. [Melita turns right and walks off a bit] Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.
Mexicans are told not to cheat. "Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child." So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns. [walks around to face her] It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.
Uh what?
Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.
How do I reeeach these keeeeds?! [the boy, cowed, slips back into his seat. Cartman faces the board] Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, "Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat." You know what happened? [dryly] They lost. [faces the class] Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.
You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
[basking in the success] I reeached these keeeds.
Let's be partners, Kenny.
Okay. [turns and follows Stan] Stan, let's be partners, dude. [Stan approaches Wendy and holds out his hand. She takes it]
Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad! [Wendy flashes him an angry look as he turns and walks away. He looks around and sees most everyone is paired off. He approaches Kyle] All right, let's be partners, Kyle.
[miffed] Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token? [Clyde and Token pair up] Who, who else needs a partner? [after the rest of the kids have paired up, only Butters is left. Cartman looks at him and he gets bashful all of a sudden, brushing his left foot back and forth on the ground] Uh who else needs a partner?
God damn it!
That isn't necessary!
You can let go now, Butters.
Butters, come on!
I wanna shoot an Indian.
Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs. [just over the greenery is Super Phun Thyme, a small attraction next door.] "Super... Phun Thyme." [turns to Butters and has him step forward] Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!
Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!
Fine, then let go of my hand!
Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!
Fine, then you're comin' with me!
Butters, let go God-damn it!
Aw man, this is gonna be awesome! [the go through the double doors] Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!
All right Butters, I've seriously had enough! [tries to rip his hand out of Butters' grip, but only succeeds in pulling Butters around. He tries again, but Butters isn't letting go. He tries a third time, all the way around, and Butters' hand is clamped on tight.] Jesus Christ! [drops the matter and goes to a counter with Butters] One please.
Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?
Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! [yanks Butters along.]
Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!
I'm having a super fun time playin
Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here! [next they're playing air hockey. They take turns, but still have to run together in switching sides. They run to Butters' side and Butters hits the puck] Oh, you got it. Nice. [they run to Cartman's side, and Cartman hits the puck. They run back to Butters' side...]
Super fun time, please don't go awahay.
No more worries or cares, super fun time.
[on a Road Hogg motorcycle ride as Butters gets on] Waiwait, keep- you're fine. [starts the ride. The motorcycle rocks back and forth quickly] Oh man, whoa!
The answer to my prayers, super fun time.
Yeheah, we're wired up!
I'll have a super fun time till I freakin; bleed.
[two cars bump into him] Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! [Butters is battered]
You make my life so right, super fun time.
Aw, just a few more things.
Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. [they leave Super Phun Thyme]
Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.
Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.
[stops in his tracks] Uh oh. [sees the police at the Pioneer Village entrance.] Crap, they called the cops on us.
They must have realized we left. Damn.
[covers Cartman's mouth and takes him behind a mail box] Shhh! Butters!
Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!
Butters, l-listen to me, listen.
All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right? [Butters calms down and stops sobbing] All right, now let go of my hand.
Butters?
All right, come on! [they head back towards Super Phun Thyme]
Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside. [turns left and points] Look, see that traffic signal down there? [the intersection is shown] If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.
Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on. [they head to the signal. Butters is lighter, so he goes up first. He pulls Cartman along up the traffic signal, then stands on the arm] Good, that's good. [Cartman stands up too] That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across. [they begin to tip-toe along the traffic signal's arm.] Go easy. Good.
It's all right. You've got it, no problem- [his left foot slips, causing them both to lose their balance] OP.
Save me!
... Oh dude, laaame.
Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look! [a big truck is headed their way] This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!
Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!
Ready? Go! [they leap off the truck and over the wooden wall. The police are not aware of this. They land on a roof and roll of it into a wooden wheelbarrow, which tips over and dumps them onto the ground.]
Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters. [they step out again and walk towards Walsky, who gets ready to shoot] Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?
Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.
Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.
What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.
Butters.
Jesus Christ! [Walsky fires off a grenade, which hits a house just as Cartman and Butters run past it. The blast blows them off their feet]
AAAAH! [this and the gunfire alert the other robbers]
[dreaming about being at the Opening Ceremonies] No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them! [The stadium lights come up and the drummers resume their drumming. Cartman is getting restless] No! No!
[talking in his sleep] They're gonna... take over the world! HAA! [The drummers start up again] Too many of them. [Cartman now dreams of walking among the drummers] No! Leave us alone! [The drummers strike solidly on their drums, and Cartman now finds himself bouncing on the drums as they rise and fall under him] Nooo! [Four different groups of Chinese Olympians surround him. Cartman wakes from his nightmare and checks his face to be sure he's not dreaming] Damn it no! No!
Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.
[sobbing] They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.
[being serious] All right. Guys, we need to talk. [no response from the other three] You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something. [the other boys stay silent] Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?
[bursts into the bathroom, startling Butters] There you are, Butters!
Butters, I need your help.
The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.
You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!
Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny. [with determination] Will you join me?
[hops onto the stool] So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!
[cups Butters' right hand between his own two hands] You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.
All right Butters, we're here. [sets the duffle bag down] Are you ready?
This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now. [points at something across the street - a P.F. Chang's China Bistro] Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. [opens the duffle bag and begins to search through it]
Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them. [pulls out a Chinese peasant hat] Here, put these teeth in! [hands him some buck teeth] And just say "herro" and "prease" a lot. [puts in his own buck teeth and squints his eyes] "Oh, herro prease." Ping pong ching chong.
[panics, voice rising] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!
Ah yes, herro prease. [puts his hands together and bows a bit] We are Chinese peopull.
Fruttar sheshar. [the greeter leaves] What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck! [goes into hushed tones and points] There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there! [Butters leans over and looks back. Sure enough, a Chinese family of five is looking at them] Do you see them?
Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.
They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go- [Butters smacks him, shutting him up] Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats. [they make their way to the family's table] Oh, herro, prease, herro.
So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.
Ting ton teetong.
Yeah, [gibberish] So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. [snickers. The family just stares at them]
All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!
Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.
What day is American invasion again? I fohget. [snickers]
[thinks a bit] ...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.
Oh my God...
Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?! [moves into the main area of the restaurant] Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies! [a couple stops eating] The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall! [points to his right] I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. [pulls a gun from a pocket and hands it to Butters]
Hold the gun on them Butters!
They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!
Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move! [the guests rise from their seats with their hands up and move over to the wall Cartman pointed to] We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!
Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!
Shoot him, Butters!
You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!
Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.
That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
[faces him] It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.
Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us! [police sirens are heard approaching] Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! [walks towards the front doors]
[walks outside] No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu- [notices something different. The camera shows that one of the police officers is Chinese] AAH! [runs back inside and back to Butters] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
[quite agitated] One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters! [heads to a window with Butters in tow, and opens it] Don't come any closer! We have information that we will only trust with the President of the United States!
No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! [Butters shuts his eyes and shoots. The Chinese officer is struck in the groin and it explodes all over his clothes]
Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!
God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!
What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool! [looks away for a few moments, but...] You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!
...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick! [walks away] God damn it!
No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I [POP. Cartman looks around, then drops the phone and runs to the source of the pop. Butters has fired the gun again. Cartman runs up to him] What happened?!
Butters
Dude...
Dude! [Butters looks to his right and down] You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. [walks off]
[near the front doors, turns around and jabs a finger at Butters] You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.
I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass. [walks out of the restaurant in defeat towards the waiting officers] That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.
I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters. [turns aside] You think about it. [turns and walks away.]
She said it again. [laughs]
[enjoying his distraction] Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?
Me? You're the one talking about killer titties. [Clyde contains a giggle] Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people. [holds his hands out as if grabbing at people] Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!
I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.
Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone. [the other boys laugh. He joins them] Dude, I'm on fire today!
Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose. [points to the ceiling] Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof. [Wendy turns and glares at him. Cartman talks into an imaginary walkie talkie] "Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!" [Wendy suddenly gets in Cartman's face]
Not at all. [cups his hands again as if they're killer titties] "Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!"
Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?
Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?
[begins to act like a gangbanger] You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.
[takes what looks like a gang pose] Whassup? [takes another one] Whassup?
Standing right here, let's go, bitch.
You're gonna fight me after school?
You're a chick, dude.
[poses again] Oh, it's on, bitch!
She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.
Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. [Cartman looks at Wendy again, and Wendy stares back. She makes a fist with her right hand and punches the open palm of her left hand.]
Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?
[almost whispering] Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-
[takes her aside and whispers] I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.
[takes her aside further and whispers] Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.
[seeing the unwanted attention] Pfft, apologize?! [begins to strike poses] That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.
Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.
[trying to put up a front] Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo. [Wendy goes back to her locker, the other kids go their separate ways. Wendy shuts her locker door and Cartman races up to her again. He whispers] Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.
[peers out from the doorway] Wendy. Wendy psst.
Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick. [Wendy goes into the room Cartman was hiding in, which is a storage room. Once inside, she looks around, taking it all in.] Wendy, you're not gonna believe this. [She turns and glares at him] I just found out my mom has breast cancer. [she glares harder] Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.
Wendy, [pulls out a letter-sized envelope] I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-
[puts his left hand up to hold her back] Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.
[thinks for a moment] My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.
Eat my underwear?
[walks a few steps away] Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.
No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.
I'll eat my underwear, Wendy. [unzips his pants.] And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.
I'm committed to peace, Wendy. [begins to swallow his underwear] I want you to see just how humbled I am... [gags]
[rather muffled] Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy. [tries one last swallow and succeeds] There. Yeahm.
So... [turns to face her] are we cool?
[throws himself at her mercy] Wendy it isn't fair! [she runs out of there quickly] I ate my underwear for you! Nooo! [Craig walks by and stops to look in] Yo, what's up dawg?
Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.
You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.
Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.
Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.
You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said "Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone." But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way- [his gag reflex kicks in and his underwear come back up his throat and out his mouth. Stan looks on a bit stunned as Cartman pulls his underwear the rest of the way out, then glances back and forth at his underwear and at Stan] Oh, that's where I put those. [puts his underwear into a back pocket] Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.
[runs to Stan's left, by the sinks] God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! [his underwear is hanging from his right hand. Cartman notices, then runs out of the bathroom. Stan looks down helplessly]
[a revelation] Detention! That's it! [begins to fidget: "I've gotta get detention, fast!" The minute hand hits 0 and Cartman runs out of his seat towards the front of the class. He gets on Mr. Garrison's desk, shoves the Homework Assignments holder off the desk, lowers his pants, and leaves a nice brown gift on the desk. Mr. Garrison looks at him. The class is stunned as Cartman looks back at Mr. Garrison]
[strikes some gang poses] Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? [Wendy's especially shocked. No one says a word until...]
[puts his feet up on the table and his hands behind his head, certain he's gotten out of the fight with Wendy] Ahhh, sweet.
What?! That's ridiculous!
That's not why I did it.
[begins to pose] Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.
Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.
[shocked] Huh?
[whining] The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. [cries into Liane's sweater. She soothes him]
The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. [cries into Liane's sweater. She soothes him again]
Okay Mommy. Mamamama.
Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.
[begins to strike poses as Wendy walks by] What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.
Why not? You chicken? [begins to strut and cluck like a chicken]
Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!
I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.
Told you guys.
[clears his throat] Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness. [Wendy lifts her head up in surprise] I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest. [stifles a laugh] We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. [stifles a laugh again]
What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey
[cautioning] Wendy, Wendy.
Go deep, Craig. [throws the football at Craig, who is off-screen] Not that deep, retard!
Butters, get out of here!
[in disbelief] ...Huh? [Butters turns left and looks at the building, smiling. Cartman looks to his right. The side doors fly open and Wendy walks down the steps spoiling for a fight. The students cheer her on as she turns left and heads for the playground. Some girls trail behind her, Bebe being the first among them.]
[wavering] What- what's up? [begins posing] What what's up? [draws close to her and cautions in a whisper] Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.
Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.
Alright, fine Wendy! I'll fight you, you big bully! [takes off his jacket and tosses it aside]
[demoralized] You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag. [begins to wail] My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. [wails some more]
That's not true. You're just saying that.
You're all just saying that to make me feel better.
Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. [the guys look at each other, sure that Cartman misunderstood them]
[seeing a positive side to this somehow] If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief! [jumps up and clicks his feet up in the air] Oh, yay! [jumps up again]
Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?
What girl is gonna see your balls?
Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
[follows] Yeah, me too. [Kyle follows Cartman and Kenny keeps dancing.]
Shut up already!
I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces... [moves Kyle's piece back seven spaces and softly says] ...screw you Kyle. [normal voice] Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. [tosses the dice to him]
So?
How much?
Really? Are you sure?
[stands up] Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.
Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?
Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?
Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.
[applauds] All right Craig! [pats him on the back]
And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
Craig, don't be an asshole.
And a one, and a two, and a- [the boys launch into their rendition of "Mary Had A Little Lamb"]
[as the men leave] Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. [in their briefcase are $10 CDs from their band, the Llama Brothers, "Tapas and Moonscapes". Man 1 whips out a fresh $10 bill and buys a CD]
Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey! [leads the other boys to the competing band]
No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!
No! No es bueno! [grabs the siku and throws it away. The band stops playing. The siku player looks at his empty hands and goes after the siku]
No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui!
Ha! [sticks his right middle finger up] Serves you right, assholes! [behind them the third band is subdued]
And we're white.
You're being extremely negative, Craig. [Chertoff and the others return]
There's no talking to this guy.
You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.
Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.
That's right.
Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. [points to his left]
What is it?
Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! [the boys enter]
Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
Dude, it's Craig!
Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?
Yeah, it's coming from up there.
Dude, that's awesome.
[Craig leads the boys across the Nazca Plateau] Dude, Craig, we should go back now.
[the boys walk through a thunderstorm] Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.
Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!
That guy's an asshole!
Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? [Stan and Kyle just look at each other.]
Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude. [Kenny indeed has a plain bologna sandwich and a glass of water.]
There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!
[puzzled] What the hell are they doing?
Dude, girls are such fags. [suddenly, Clyde, Craig, Jimmy, Token, and Jason leave the table and join the girls]
This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. [silence follows for a few seconds, then Stan holds up the DVD case]
Well, I'm out guys. [get up from the sofa, puts on his jacket, and heads for the front door] If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.
Ehhhhhhh. [Stan stops writing]
I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. [The bell rings and Mr. Garrison walks in with his books]
You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.
Fuck you, Kyle! [upon entering the building, they are met by a pre-class musical production]
Oh God, shut up!
Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!
Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle. [Stan walks into the living room and stands to one side of the sofa] Yeah, nice.
No way dude.
Shut up, Scott Malkinson. "I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes."
"Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson." [Kenny laughs]
"That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes."
I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.
You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.
That's a low blow, Stan.
[approaches two other kids]
And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
Don't stress about it or you just might faint.
Oh, who just shot me? [Bebe leans back in her chair, looks at Cartman, and gives him the finger]
Oh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.
All right Butters, well you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.
Yeah, now get out of here.
Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!
Butters? [Butters continues] Butters?! [Butters backs up and then hops off the bed]
Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!
Dude! [Liane enters]
Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!
Yes.
Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?
Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened. [the boys are looking at Kenny and a girl eating alone together at another table.] Kenny has a girlfriend.
Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
[getting irritated] Butters, what's the problem?
That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!
Kenny. [deep sigh, puts his right hand on Kenny's back for sympathy] Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.
[moments later] He took it pretty well.
The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? [Kenny continues walking, the other three join him as he walks across the parking lot]
[forcibly stops Kenny] Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!
[reaches out to Kenny and stops him] Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?
Well well well, here he comes. It's B.J. McKay and his best friend Bear.
Purity ring?
[takes the DVD and looks at the front cover. Kenny freezes with his left hand held out] Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!
[notices that Kenny has stopped responding.] Kenny? Kenny? [snaps his fingers] Kenny? [snaps his fingers again] Wanna look at Playboy? [snaps his fingers again] Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?
[notices something on the shelf next to him] Oh my God, look at this! [grabs it and looks at it] Motherfucker!
"Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings." These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! [throws the magazine to the floor]
Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!
This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by [a dart strike him in the neck and knocks him out quick] teh- ...tehhhh [falls on his face]
The hell did you do to us?!
[during the eulogy] I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.
And knowing is half the battle.
[voice over] The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse. [A shot of Tele's TV store "Closed until further notice due to BAD ECONOMY"] The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down. [a shadow runs across the screen, in a cape. Next scene: an alley looking towards the street. An Obama poster for CHANGE is shown, with WHEN? spray-painted over the word] Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things. [the shadow climbs up a pipe and runs across the roof of the building opposite the alley entrance] He didn't. [next shot is that of a street under a threatening red sky] As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection. [another alley. An aluminum trash can falls over, spilling its contents. The shadow appears on a wall, larger than life, then runs away] There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage. [A rain gutter is shown. The shadow runs across the screen again, closer to the camera] To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man. [another rooftop. The camera finds the shadow and zooms in on it.] I'm the hero this town needs. I am... [the shadow turns and is lit up. It's Cartman dressed as...] the Coon! [Cartman looks up to the sky, and graphics for "The Coon" pop up. Next scene, the Coon runs down a street and leaps onto the roof of a car] As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. [he leaps off the car]
Hey guys. Good morning. [the guys don't respond to him at all] You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.
I know, right? [enunciating] "Who is the Coon?" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.
[stunned, turns to Kyle and points] You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!
He's not a fag!
[straightens up and moves off a bit] Oh. I uh... well I ah ah [crosses his arms] I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term "fag," Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante? [neither of them answer him] Kenny?
And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he? [he's wearing a "Who is the Coon?" shirt] Is he a hero or a menace? [half the class is bored, and Clyde is asleep at his desk. Mr. Garrison reads quietly at his desk] While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... "Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?" What we all need now- [spots the sleeper] Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important. [Clyde wakes up and looks around in a daze] What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.
[voice over. He's seated alone on a merry-go-round] Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens. [shuts his eyes] No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus. [opens his eyes, keeping a look of determination on his face] Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.
[sadly] Hunh!
I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!
I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!
[suddenly hopeful, looks at the TV] Wha, what?
[angrily] What?!
Fuckin' butthole!
You gotta be kidding me!
[shakes in anger] AAAAAHT!! [turns right and leaves in a huff]
So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!
Really?! Nobody was playing with any fireworks?! [grabs Stan's right hand and sniffs it vigorously, then lets it go and looks around for other suspects]
Aha! Kenny! I should have known! [walks over to Kenny's locker and points] Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?! [points at Kenny] Unless you are Mysterion!
What?! Why?
It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!
[gasps and walks away a bit to watch Wendy leave] Fucking bitch...
[offscreen] Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!
And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...
[arrives and sighs] Hengh! [the squirrels run off] Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS! [stomps his left foot down] Hengh!
[leaps towards him] Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!
The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!
Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.
I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. [begins to sob, and a rowdy crowd approaches from the right]
Did somebody say "catch a Jew"? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.
[stands up in his seat] All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool! [checks for a reaction] That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick! [clears his throat and sits down] Go ahead, Kyle.
Oh man, I thought that day would never end.
Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!
No! No, nono, you're right Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny. [walks from his locker to the middle of the hall, turns around, farts, and walks back to his locker. A little girl walks into the fart fumes and all the boys laugh]
Let's get to my house!! [the boys run out of school chattering away while the girls remain in the hall annoyed]
[walks in with some snacks for himself and spots Craig on the sofa] Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig.
It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! [Craig moves to an empty spot on the floor as Cartman takes his place on the sofa]
What?
What the fuck is this?!
Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!
You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!
Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?! [more girls begin to appear]
You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy! [the girls have heard enough and leave]
And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...
Yes, that's good.
Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?
We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.
You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes.
Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you [points to the poster] it's not a joke.
Sick! Stop it, lady!
It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.
Hey Jimmy, what are you up to? [closes the door and walks up to Jimmy]
Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.
[heads to the sofa and lays down on his back] Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.
[while munching] No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else.
No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else. [Jimmy sighs and throws away a sheet of jokes. Hours later there are many more sheets on the floor]
Meh. [Jimmy tosses away another crumpled sheet]
Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?
Yeah, I like fishsticks.
What, dude, you got something?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[thinks through the joke] Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys.
Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.
Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?
Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?
[points to Clyde with both index fingers] What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?
Token, Token, got a question for you: [clears his throat] Token, do you like fishsticks?
[motions to Butters to keep quiet for now] Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters. [back to Token] You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
What are you?
And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.
Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.
Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.
Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! [smiles, takes his tray and walks away]
[shakes with rage, then turns left and walks away] Motherfucker!
Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!
Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!
But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!
What?!
Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?
Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?
Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.
Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish? [Jimmy and Cartman laugh, but Cartman notices something on Jimmy's desk.] Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! [gets off the couch, gets a newspaper, walks over to the desk, and smashes the spider dead.]
Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.
It's cool man, it's cool. [turns around and walks away]
Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?
[walks off a bit] It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke. [Kyle zips up and goes to the sink to wash his hands] I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. [Kyle finishes up, grabs a paper towel, wipes his hands dry, and turns to Cartman]
You do?
[after some thought] But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?
Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?
That's cool. You wanna write some together? [walks out of view]
[pulls up a chair] Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks.
Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer. [she walks off] Now let's see... The setup could be... "Do you like fishsticks?"
So then I can say, "What are you, a gay fish?"
It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! [leaps out of his seat with a sword out of nowhere and slashes the dragon across the chest, making it bleed. It falls on its back all of a sudden. Eric leaps onto its body and stabs the sword into its chest. It dies.]
Thanks you guys!
Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.
Hi Ellen. [to the audience] Do you guys like fishsticks? [the audience laughs] Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.
Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.
Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. [the audience applauds and cheers]
Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.
Uhhh excuse me? [the crowd gets rowdy.]
Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.
Yeah, that was kewl huh?
Whassat?
So... here it is.
That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did! [Kanye kicks the bedroom door open and enters the room. His men pour in and start smashing the furniture apart] Dude, it's Puff Daddy!
Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!
Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!
Hello Jim.
[moves the glasses back over his cap] What are you up to?
Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. [goes for a chair]
Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.
Thanks. [Sarah walks away] So, what I'm thinking is, "Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?" [something crashes into the house, making it shake violently. Jimmy and Cartman look around.]
Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here? [takes off his glasses] Flame on! [becomes engulfed in flames and flies into the air. He then sends streams of flames at the robots, destroying them instantly. He flies back down to his starting point] Flame off! [the flames disappear. Other fourth graders appear: Annie, Millie, Red, Clyde, Token and Wendy]
Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke! [runs in and finishes the joke in a flourish. Jimmy walks in] "Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?" There! [other kids look in]
Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.
You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.
Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.
All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.
I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are. [Kanye looks as if Cartman is talking about him] Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.
You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!
Haven't you assholes been watching the news? [rolls the map flat on the table] Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here: [points to the circled nation on the map] Somalia.
North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.
I've worked it all out on Expedia. [traces the route from Denver to Somalia] We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.
Right, and wi- [stops] Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.
Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.
Then why don't you wanna go?
That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle. [rolls up the map] Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! [walks away]
Avast there, mateys! [the class looks up at the speaker] Do ya have a thirst for adventure on the high seas of life? [a shot of some kids in the hall, including sixth graders] Arrre you sick and tired of your parents and teachers telling you what to do all the time? [a shot of the kindergarten class, and its teacher] Then join Captain Cartman's Perfect Pirate Club, arrrr! [back to Mr. Garrison's class] Just imagine it, me hearties! A life without rules, without homework and chores! You can live the pirate's life in Somalia, me friends! [Kyle looks at the blackboard, his eyes half-closed. Stan begins to write stuff down] Even Kyle said so. [Kyle buries his face into his desk] Our first official pirate mee'in will be 4 pm today at Kevin Stoley's house!
There will be refreshments served! So make sure your mom goes to the grocery store, Kevinnn! So come one, come all! The invitation is open to any student who wants to be a pirate, and who isn't Jewish, Mexican or ginger! Arrrgh!
Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh... [sees Gordon Stoltski, then goes into a low voice] Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r?
But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.
Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'!
We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!
Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore?
Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits! [holds up a jeweled sword]
Kevin, Goddammit! [Kevin turns off the lightsaber's light]
We be headin' to Somaaliaa. By way of Miami to Cairo. And take care o' you put us in an exit row, you land lubber!
That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.
What?!
You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?
Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!
Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?
The FUCK?! [some Somalis notice them and stop to look] 'Scuse me, where are the pirates? [stops a man walking by] Hey, hey we're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh! [the man ignores him and keeps on walking.] Butters, get the phrase book out. [Butters approaches with the phrase book in hand] Ask these people where the pirates are.
Ah, nice. Come on, mateys! [the boys turn and walk towards the building]
Yes, bebebudjuhbluhbluhbluhbluh. Thank you. [dismissing the warning, he and his crew continue on to the building.]
Avast! [no one else says a word. In a low voice, he says] These aren't pirates, they're just a bunch of black people.
I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with.
Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates.
Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads. [they all stop next to a small boat]
This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!
Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front.
Kevin, Jesus Christ! [a pirate starts the motor and the boat moves forward] Hard to starboard, lads! There's sure to be lots of booties out hyah! [Clyde begins to cry] Clyde, the fuck?!
Calm down, Clyde. Everything's gonna be okay!
Ike, will you do something about Clyde, please? [Ike looks at Clyde and smacks him. Clyde stops crying] Very nice, Ike. [looks ahead] All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder! [before them is a French cruise ship]
Du-dude! You're doing it all wrong! Let me handle this. [takes the bullhorn from him] Alright ya scalliwags! Surrender your plunder and let me send my shot across your bow!
Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!
The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!
Alright, let's go! [the boys go up the ladder and board the ship]
Quiet, you sons of biscuit eaters! This boat is now pirate propertih! Now get ye to your lifeboat, lest you wanna be shark bait!
Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours!
I said, get off my boat!
That's it! Get in there you swarmy dogs! [the captain and crew get on the lifeboat] Lower 'em down, Ike. [Ike lowers the lifeboat to the ocean]
Hard to port, lads!
Just make the boat go that way, kind of. [the ship ends up turning towards shore, towards the pirates' lair. The pirates have just finished tying up their boat when they stop and look towards the sea. The ship's horn blows and the ship heads towards the dock] That's good. Now bring her around topside. [the cruise ship pulls up alongside the pier and lowers the rope ladder. The boys get off the ship and head back to the lair. Cartman stops for a moment and points it out to the pirates] Now that's a pirate ship! [the boys head into the pirates' lair] A fine day o' plunderin' we had, boys! What about yourselves? [starts tossing wads of cash at pirates] Here you are, lads. Plenty of booty to go around. [walks to an open table and has the boys sit there] A round of grog for me boys! [a pirate brings drinks to the table and passes them out] A round of grog for everyone! [the pirate leaves] The fuck is this? This is water in a Dixie cup! Alright, Goddammit, really you guys! What kind of pirates are you?! Look at yourselves! You disgrace the Blackbeard! I don't know where you people get off calling yourselves pirates! [gets up and walks around] Little beat-up boats, water in Dixie cups. I mean, I mean look, look at this guy! [the pirate he's looking at has lost his left leg from the knee down] Look at this guy for Christ's sake! [rips a leg from a chair and ties it up the pirate's left leg] I mean, how hard is this, people?! [the pirate grins and hobbles away with his new peg leg. Cartman walks back to the boys' table, then stands on it] I tell you lads, if we're gonna be the most feared people on Earth, then there needs to be some Goddamned changes around here!
[sighs] Goddamnit people!
And with a yee hee hee!
We take to the African sea!
Nice.
And a tricky lahty do!
Okay okay, let's stop there for a minute. Remember, on tricka lahty do, that's a "lahty do" Okay, really need you guys to enunciate the "lahty" Uh, Nadif, if I can get you and Abdikaram to sing the harmony on the second "yo ho". And uh, Hashmish, is it? I'm sorry, but you're a little flat. Remember to sing out, don't close your throat, m'kay? So let's go from uh, bar 14. We'll pick up after the quarter rest. Ike? [Ike is at a spinet piano]
Better!
And a tricky lahty do!
Somaliaaan piiiraaates weeeeee.
What did I tell you, Butters? This is the good life, huh? [a shot is heard, followed by commotion from the pirates. Cartman and the boys walk over to a crowd of pirates gathered around something] What's going on?
Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom. [the crowd splits in two and Kyle is shown. Kyle is tied up so he can't use his arms. Ike looks happy to see Kyle.] Well well well well well!
Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.
"It isn't safe." That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was "awesome."
Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.
Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm.
Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog!
That's Captain Cartman, you Jewswoggle!
What?!
Clyde!
[threatens the other three boys with his sword; they back down] You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old!
Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit! [whistles] To arms! [the real pirates gather around and aim their rifles at the boys] Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an entire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!
Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever! [a volley of bullets takes down all the pirates, leaving the six boys unharmed. The boys look at the carnage around them]
The FUCK?!
'Sup, Jew?
HA! What a dumbass!
Billy Mays? Billy Mays?! [hops off the sofa] Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!
Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?
The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here! [quickly flips through the channels until a Billy Mays commercial appears] Here here! This, this is him!
That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.
Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.
Because he was a great person, Kyle.
...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...
Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.
Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.
[concerned] Oh my God... poor Billy Mays...
Billy Mays! [makes his way to the front of the group] It's him!
Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays!
Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!
[rolls his eyes up in thought] Was I alarmed? [closes his eyes] Yes. [opens them and looks at Kyle] I believe I was.
[correcting him] Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. [Kyle's jaw drops in alarm]
Yes!
Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal! [Kyle puts his hands down below the table] People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! [points to Stan]
A child... and a female. And white.
Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!
God I hope this works.
Hey, what the F?!
Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge. [a shot of the judge] She's eating Chipotle.
So maybe she doesn't know. [grabs Kyle by his coat collar] Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle.
Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?
What if you didn't have to give it up?
I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.
Yeah!
Alright! [one of the contestants stomps her foot and cries, then walks off stage]
Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.
Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this. [Cartman and Craig are at a tetherball pole, and Cartman is holding the ball. Around them are a bunch of boys, most of them from the fourth grade] Alright, you ready? Now say "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me." Come on, dude, "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me." [the camera pulls back a bit, and Butters is seen at the top of the tetherball pole, hanging from his briefs.]
Alright, your turn Craig.
Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.
Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl. [Craig hits the ball and it wraps around the pole until it hits Butters on the face]
Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.
Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?
Atta boy Butters!
Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?
Dude, we've created a monster.
Oh my God, dude, this is sooo awesome!
Oh, sweet! [the woman in black bra pulls on the other woman's arm using her right leg as leverage, then begins pummeling her. Cena throws Edge against the ropes]
This is awesome!
Dude! That was so badass!
The fuck is this?!
I did. I'm the Rad Russian. [affects a fake Russian accent] I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!
All right!
The Rad Russian.
You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!
Huh?
Okay...
The fuck is this?!
Dude! Dude! DUDE! [jumps to his feet] The fuck are you doing?!
That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!
Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. [they all take off their headgear and walk away]
The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say "You slept with my girlfriend," and I'll charge you into a head slap.
Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like "No no, the fight hasn't started yet," and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.
Noo, let's save the "girlfriend is a whore" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.
Alright are you ready to try this, guys?
Alright, let's start wrestlin'. [the boys take their starting positions]
You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw! [Cartman slaps him hard, and Jimmy falls. Butters intervenes.]
Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste-[Jimmy sneaks up behind him with a folding chair and smashes it into the back of his head, making him fall forward] ah!
[whispers aloud] Wait for it, wait for the whore line.
And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!
Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.
It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. [the crowd boos and expresses its disapproval]
Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.
I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! [screams, runs up to Stan with a steel chair, and smashes him with it, knocking him down]
Alright you guys, let's bring it in. [the boys huddle and hold hands] I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?
Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.
[rushing in with a letter] You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!
We just received a letter from the WWE.
"Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling organization and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth."
Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.
Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.
Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.
And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.
Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.
Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!
Right?
No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.
Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!
Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.
Number seventeen step forward, please? [a man steps forward shielding his eyes from the glare of the spotlights] You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go!
Thank you! Number twenty-four? [another man steps forth as Number 17 returns to his place] You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!
Thank you. [Number 24 returns to his place]
Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again. [Number 37 steps forward] We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?
Yeah, this guy crushes.
[preparing to dress as Irene] Alright, places everyone.
[over the speakers] Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown. [An opera box has been built to accommodate McMahon. It has four seats, and an usher takes McMahon and assistant to their seats. Vince has his own personal Playbill with "WTF" on the cover]
My man can do whatever he wants.
You're just gonna have to deal with that.
My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.
Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!
You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!
O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!
Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw. [The coach picks up the RPGL, puts it on his shoulder, and takes aim] We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!
Hey, what about us? Our show? [the coach is now grinning as the two men walk away]
This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!
Oh, don't start with me, Kenny!
Kenny! I'm-
Can't read my, can't read my,
What do you mean? This song is sweet.
I'm not too busy, Stan.
No, I just don't care. At all.
[speaking into the mic] Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!
I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be.
Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! [his sweater has "SAVE THE WHALES" on it, while Kenny's parka now has "DOLPHIN LOVER" on it].
What dude?
We always have.
That's not what we said.
We were talking about Wales the country.
[under his breath] Kenny! [to Stan] I deserve to be on TV.
[popping up in front of the camera] All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys! [grins and pumps a fist]
Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!
[gets emotional] Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like [sniff], we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures.
Shhh, Kenny... [the camera zooms in on Kenny, who's got his face in his hands] Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he- [flashes an angry look at the camera] Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though. [The camera pulls back to its previous position] Yeah, keep it there. [Cartman resumes his tale] He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything.
Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese. [small plane engines are now heard. Cartman, Stan, and the others begin to look around]
Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales. [the Japanese boats pulls up to the boys' location and stops.] Uh oh.
Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!
You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! [goes back to his song. Stan goes to the cell door and looks out]
Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?
What dude?
Sorry. [clears his throat.] A little gassy. 'Scuse me.
So that's what this has all been about?
Zzzzt zzzzsssht! [whispers aloud] Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.
Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?
God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of assholes on their Harley motorcycles show up?! [the bikers just cheer each other on, but the motors drown them out]
Piss off, you stupid assholes! [the bikers ride off]
[walking into view] Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes! [the bikers quiet down, turn off their motors, and look at him] You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right?
You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?
No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags. [proceeds to walk past the line of bikes]
But Cartman isn't letting up on him. [the bikers roll by and the boys stop playing]
Agreed.
Ni-nice, okay.
What?
I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.
[taking notes] Yeah, I think that'll be nice.
I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.
That was us!
Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?
Oh, they think we meant gay fags.
Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?
You call them "bike-curious".
Oh yeah, nice, Kenny. [Kenny gets the ball and throws it to Stan, who dribbles it a bit and gets ready to shoot]
Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.
Emmanuel Lewis, huh?
No! That'll just make you bigger fags!
Oh it's over, it's finally over! [he and Kenny do a shoulder embrace. Stan walks up to the camera]
Oh. My. Goodddd.
Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?
[cackles] He stutters like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag! [another boy walks up and sits in the chair to Cartman's right. Cartman notices immediately: the boy is well-dressed] Who are you?
Mr. Mackey, what's a moronic jizzrag?
Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece? [Mr. Mackey opens his office door to yell at Casey]
Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed in to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well. [reads the next announcement] For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger! [Wendy's mouth drops open] Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia! [Clyde has gone to sleep, half the class is getting sleepy, Stan buries his head in his arms] It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.
But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!
You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!
Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!
You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!
Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!
Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field. [The first or second grade class is shown] I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions. [next day] Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school- [next day] And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' "Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that." [next day] I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school.
- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -
Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class, [The lights go down and a monitor is shown above Mr. Garrison's desk] you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.
Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again. [exhales forcefully] Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back. [leaves his desk and walks over to a mobile blackboard] So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs.
I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why [writes Y on the board], we're gonna transform into something.
"Thank you" and this is to..?
[signs a copy] "To Douglas." There you go. [gives it to him] Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.
Well hello. Another person who [looks to his right and tries to get the other kids' attention as they stream into the cafeteria] cares about the future of our school?
Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.
That'll be five dollars.
A book signing.
I do not directly say she's a slut!
[leans over the table and points somethoug out to him] You didn't read the rest, dude.
"Or does she?" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!
You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?
Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?
And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!
Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!
Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! I'm walking out and I'm never coming back! [turns and storms out of the office.]
Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being allowed to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs. [an animated sequence begins. Smurf Village is shown] I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust. [one day he steps up, and they gather round him] It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. [they bring him a cap big enough to fit his head, he puts it on and grins. The camera pans up and the title of his animation appears: Dances with Smurfs]
The smurfs and I grew to understand each other. [Cartman is now dressed as a Smurf, but only his face is painted blue. He's harvesting berries with the Smurfs] They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette. [He and the diminutive Smurfette sit on a log watching the sun set] We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.
Papa Smurf was displeased at first, [Cartman tries to catch up to Smurfette as her father takes her into their mushroom house] He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.
And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs! [Butters sobs] Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD. [holds up the DVD case] The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?
Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.
People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.
Of course. That's why we're here.
Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you. [sits down and gets his notes ready as the chimes come in] Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.
Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.
How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? [Wendy doesn't answer, and Cartman studies her reaction]
You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.
Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?
If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? [Wendy doesn't answer]
You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?
Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?
What? What do you mean I know that?
No! You wiped them all out!
Wait, hold on, can we take a break?
Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-
No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!
You sold the movie rights to who?!
Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!
[crossing the street] Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes! [turns around and rants at the theater] You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA! [gives the theater two middle fingers three times] You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! [gives the theater two middle fingers three more times]
Huh!
No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!
I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded! [the chimes come on]
I'm doin' the best I can! [begins to cry, leaves his desk, and runs out of the classroom bawling.]
We're going to the water park,
This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.
No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.
You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.
Come on, let's go!
[hands the clerk some money] Six adorable children, please.
Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool! [finally gets to the wave pool, but gets pissed off] Oh, what the hell?! [the pool is quite crowded with people of all races enjoying themselves. The other five boys catch up to Cartman]
[with a stunned look on his face] Forget it! Just forget it! [walks off in anger. The other five are confused]
What has happened to this place?
Just do it in English!
There are too many minorities (too many)
[running up to the boys] You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!
I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? And there are a hundred and ninety black people!
So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!
...What do you mean?
The black and brown people.
Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's a fifty percent rise in one, year!
Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!
The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!
You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on! [only Kyle is left at the table, and Cartman remembers this and slowly turns to him] Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan's prediction from coming true, buddy?
Help! Help!
Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me! [grabs onto the branch and is hoisted onto the boat. He catches his breath] Oh, oh, oh. [sits up and looks around - it's all minorities in the boat]
Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.
[pulls out a memo pad and pen and writes the following] Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what's on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live. [puts the pad and pen away somewhere...] Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. [the other survivors just look at him]
It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is "Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... [imagines himself in class with a bunch of non-white students]
I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.
...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.
Noooo... [now imagines himself at a job interview] Trying to find a job will be even harder.
Well, I do just as much work.
Noooo... [now imagines himself at an open council meeting] Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.
Noooo...
[throws down his pad and pen and stands up] NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! [turns away and squeezes his eyes shut.]
Guys? Guys! [walks into view and hugs Stan] Oh it's true! You all did survive!
Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?
It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!
[playing as Tiger] Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! [Stan and Kyle walk into the store and spot the other two boys]
Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. [onscreen, Elin is chasing the SUV and leaving cracks in the rear windows with each swing of the club]
Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash! [Cartman loses control of the SUV, which hits a fire hydrant, then a tree. Elin catches up to the SUV as Tiger opens the door and staggers out, a bit dazed. The radiator is letting out steam]
Oh dude, was that a combo move?
Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.
Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.
I told you this game was sweet, dude.
Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?
Oh, you're going down, Elin!
Oh no! [Elin continues beating up Tiger] Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?
Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??
What the hell?! This game's all boring now!
Dude, screw this! [gets off the sofa and throws his controller to the floor, then walks away] Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!
[sarcastically, folds his arms together] Aww, books? God, I hate those!
Oh really? Sweet.
Oho man, I can't wait!
No on, come on, let's read it now!
Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!
Motherfucker! [Kyle turns around to face him, Stan stands up and walks up to him] The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, "alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming," and then after like a hundred pages I was like "alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end," and then I got to the last page, and I was all "the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!"
They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! [the door opens again and Kenny enters with his book]
We know, we were just saying that.
It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!
Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.
The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.
It was a... a warm spring morning. [background music plays and a montage follows. Next is the school playground where, as other kids play, Stan and the other three sit on the steps of a side entrance and continue working on their book, with Cartman taking notes Next is Stan's room where Stan is typing the next part of the book. The boys are having fun with the writing. Next scene is in Cartman's room where Cartman is again writing the story down. Kyle has brought Ike over for company. Finally, a few days later, Sharon enters Stan's room to put away his clean clothes. She puts away some underwear, but notices something in the drawer. Under Stan's shirts is the manuscript to the story the boys have been working on. Sharon reaches for it.]
Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!
...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!
Butters, what are you up to?
Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.
Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
That's right.
Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!
That inconsiderate jerk!
There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!
There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!
All right you guys, I know what we have to do. [stands up and walks onto the street] We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker.
Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.
Shhh. [addresses Ms. Parker] Be right with you. [hushed tones to the other boys] We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.
Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.
[turns and walks over to Ms. Parker] Ms. Jessica Parker, over here. [Kenny follows.]
See any hunters yet?
Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.
So what?
Oh dude, sweet! [all four boys walk away, leaving Ms. Parker all alone at the mercy of any moose hunter that walks by her]
People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
What?!
Oh come on!
Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.
That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.
[sighs heavily] You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.
Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. [walks out of the room with the other boys]
[after "27"] Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.
[faking] I know, it sucks. [the coach blows his whistle as the boys reach "40"]
[grins and throws his sports bottle away] KFC!! [races for his ride]
Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you! [remembers where he is] Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!
Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!
They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!
Mom, drive faster!
Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!
WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!
Fuck you!
No! No, what's going on?! [quickly gets out of the car and shoves a worker aside] Move aside! [stops at the front door and looks up again]
No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!
You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
Nooooooooo-! [his head explodes]
[looking fatigued and feeling quite itchy] I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. [sniffs heavily]
[hops onto a little stool in front of the counter] Really?
Whoa, what uh, are you serious? [fills out the application as she gets a treatment out of a cabinet. He turns around...] Oh my God, that's KFC gravy! [quite giddy] You have KFC! Yes! [she opens the gravy and pours some into a small cup, then slides the cup to him. He's disappointed] This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!
Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!
[grabs it from her hand] NO! [swallows it as fast as he can] Oh God, oh God it's so good.
Yeah. Who isn't?
Billy Miller? Seriously??
Tommy said you have some KFC.
Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce! [eats them as fast as he can] Oh God yes! [finishes it off] Where did you get that?!
85 bucks?? I don't have that! [three boys behind him get serious and approach him. One of them has a bat]
How much KFC are we talking?
Holy fuck, dude.
Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?
Are you Teabag?
Cut the crap. You got the stuff?
Extra crispy? [opens a small bowl of gravy and samples it carefully]
You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT! [reaches behind his back for a pistol and aims it at Teabag]
You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!
[lunges at him with the pistol, making him get on all fours] Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!
Nothin', it's cool.
Yeah I got the stuff. [the other boys carry the bags away] And I got the money. [tosses the wad of bills back at Billy]
Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. [burps]
Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?
Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?
I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.
Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked.
Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!
Good.
[munching on a breast from a bucket] Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!
[munching on a drumstick, his back to Billy] Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!
...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.
I... [turns around to face Billy] told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.
Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?
Bye bye Billy. [Billy leaves] Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.
Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!
What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay. [leaves the throne] Put him on speaker.
Colonel, how are you doing?
[rips the skin off a breast and lays it on the table] Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? [takes out a credit card and starts mincing the skin as if it were crack cocaine, into lines of finely ground skin]
We had a little problem.
[snorts a line into his nose] Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?
Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.
Hey, take it easy Colonel.
[grabs the phone] Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?! [hears someone breaking in and looks over his shoulder] Oh crap! [five men pour into the basement and start firing their machine guns at the boys, who scatter and try to escape. Two more men jump into the basement. More men outside the house begin firing their weapons. The police arrive and begin firing at the attackers]
I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.
[retorts] Stupid Facebok stuff.
Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.
Surprise! [smiles]
Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy.
Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends. [begins to gloat] And he's had a profile for more than six months.
[in a video podcast] Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast! [Mad Friends podcast. Cartman sits behind a Mad Friends desk. At the bottom of the screen are two tickers. The upper one shows changes in friend stocks, the lower one shows Facebook updates] Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends! [rings a bell and leaves his chair] Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon. [presses a big red button, which produces a shotgun blast] You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why? [shows a birthday cake] Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita. [presses a button that produces the sound of a whistle] If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street. [cranks up a player that repeats "Word On The Street"] The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger [presses a robot that says "MERGER"] So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle!
You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.
Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.
It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?
Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?
Okay let's, let's try this one.
Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas. [goes onto the next person] Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?
This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.
Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!
Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off... [coughs to clear his throat] That's a dude jacking off...
Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle! [Kyle turns and goes back to Cartman's desk.] Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there.
Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.
Wow, coo'.. [snaps a picture] Chocolate rules!
AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!
I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.
Hey, that is Tom Cruise! [snaps a picture]
Excuse me... [the celebrities turn around] This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?
I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...
Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?
Uh, excuse us for a second... [walks away]
Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?
Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!
If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are... [looks at his hand, then removes his hand's hairpiece] Mitch Conner.
You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!
Yeah, so what?
So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.
No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.
You just had seven tacos.
I'm sorry [whisper] Why are you doing this?
[whispering] You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off! [Charlie Sheen steps forward]
Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
I tried getting one last week!
God, will somebody shut her up?
I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. [Mitch goes in front of Cartman]
Let me by...
Screw this Conner. [pushes his hand away and moves on] Find yourself another partner.
My father...
I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.
How could you know anything about who my family is?
If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-
Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?
I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.
I said GET. Mr. Hat!
Put it on! [he puts it on] Do the voice.
Keep... your hand... UP!
By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?
That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!
[quickly gets in] Ahaaa!
Nice work, Conner.
Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!
Them who?!
Then start explaining it to me!
No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!
It's all that matters!
I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!
Who you calling stupid, Jew?
Gingers? No!
Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?
Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?
Hello? I'm here, whoever you are. [a slow cackle rises from the darkness]
Daddy?
[strokes his chin and thinks] Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.
Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.
What do you know?!
Mom?
Protect who??
My dad was a Denver Bronco?
No- nooo.
No! Noooo!
Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?
My dad was a ginger!
I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
What?
Cheer up? I'm half ginger!
Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.
Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?
Take it easy, Conner. [his hand floats away, then opens up all of a sudden. He wiggles his fingers. Next shot is of Tom Cruise sitting by himself on a trash can.]
[reads his note] Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-.
I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right? [clears his throat] The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- [Kyle walks over and rips the note from Cartman's hands]
I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!
[takes his note back. Kyle walks back to his seat] You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society. [puts down that sheet, but reaches into his back pocket for another one] Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?
If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom. [puts the note on top of the pile and sits there quietly]
[crying quietly] Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay?
It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?! [buries his head in his lap and cries some more]
Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!
[sniffs] No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! [cries some more]
[cynically, walks off a bit] Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver. [turns around and faces the boys] Look at me! [gestures to himself] Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? [turns away]
No I can't; I'll always be like this. [wipes tears away]
Come on you guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! [cries some more]
I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!
Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!
You love NASCAR huh?
You see I told you guys! [turns and walks to his locker] What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! [puts his arm on the locker and rests his head on his arm]
[lifts his head up] I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack. [goes back to crying]
Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.
[stops crying and brightens up] You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. [smiles]
Then maybe I can make myself believe it too. [getting confident] Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream. [Stan and Kyle just look at each other.]
Butters.
Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up. [pumps both fists] I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and [pumps both fists] I'm psyched!
But [points his right index finger at him] I'm gonna need your help. [points both index fingers at him] Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get [pumps both fists twice] psyched up??
Get really psyched up, Butters!
I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!
I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters, [reaches to his left and pulls into view a water jug full of small change] Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.
[points] Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back. [lowers his finger] From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.
[points] I told you I'm serious, Butters. [lowers his finger] This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.
Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men.
Not yet.
Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!
Fucking gross!
[quickly rights himself and stands up] Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?! [clicks on the remote control to reverse it, then plays and echoes the commercial] "In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss." [clicks the remote to pause the playback] Oh my God, Butters... [makes a fist with his left hand] we need Vagisil!
"Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes."
Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.
I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?
Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here. [positions him] Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me. [As Butters keeps a look out, Cartman opens a tube of Vagisil anti-itch cream and begins to swallow it. Then he takes a bottle of wash and chugs that down, following that up with two more tubes, then more products] Is anybody coming?
Mm, 'kay, Mm. [throws the bottle away] N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... [grabs a tube of maximum strength anti-itch cream]
Oh my God! Butters! [taps Butters' shoulder and Butters turns around] I feel kind of stupid!
Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.
Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!
[walks towards the car] Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! [puts on the helmet and climbs into the car]
[Swallows another tube of Vagisil] Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR.
Let's go NASCAR! [the other drivers zoom past him. He steers the wheel, but realizes] I'm not moving, Butters.
What's that?
Oh okay. [leans down to press it. He burns rubber and takes off, as "La Grange" by ZZ Top plays] Let's go NASCAR! [he immediately crashes into the wall and tries to power out of it. Suddenly, he turns left and goes back the other way]
Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet! [the other drivers round the corner and avoid him. Car #78 crashes through the wall and plows up the bleachers. Cartman tries to turn around but goes up into the air and into the pit area. Everyone there gets out of the way. He hits a low wall and goes up into the air again...]
[abash] Oh, fuck my ass! [he lands in a lake by the Winners Circle.]
All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.
[looks away] Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.
I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.
Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.
Aw donkey balls...
Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.
Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?
Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again. [Butters brightens up]
Oh hey, Kenny! [Kenny is not happy and his arms are crossed]
Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on. [Kenny follows him in. Cartman shows him all the stuff he purchased - a jet ski, a Room-bot, a 7.1 speaker system, a plasma TV, an LCD monitor, a VHS/DVD combo player] Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? [Kenny is still pissed off]
Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.
[annoyed] Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!
Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I've had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!
I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do! [Kenny raises his fists up, but Cartman hugs him with one arm] Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.
Yeah?
...Uh oh.
Awww, sweet! [runs to the car, then runs his right hand over the body] No way, this is so tits!
Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!
Aww coool, huh Kenny? [Makes engine revving and shift change noises] I got a NASCAR, Kenny! [Geoff looks at Kenny, smiling] So awesome, huh Kenny? [Kenny can only look on angrily]
[doing a redneck accent and acting completely stupid] Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.
Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.
Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!
Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!
Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.
Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'... [holds up a bottle] Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme. [squeezes some out and rubs it all over his lips] Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this "Obama" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline! [spits into a can] What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell! [Kenny buries his face in the counter, in shame. On screen, Butters appears behind Cartman] You all know my pit boss, Butters. [Butters appears over by the grill, also with a mouthful of Vagisil]
He's fuckin' gay as hell!
[dips again and rubs it on his lips] So y'all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!
Alright, "start your engine." What's that mean?
[in the redneck accent] Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward. [does so and rear-ends #78, then back up and swerves onto the track and sideswipes #95 and #78] NASCAR! Yee-ah!
Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! [hits the brakes and #7 runs into him. Danica Patrick is the driver]
[gives her the middle finger] Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal! [steps on the gas and peels away. Other cars pass Danica, whose engine is now on fire]
Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!
Oh yeah, I see it. [Cartman avoids the car, but runs over Danica, who was trying to make it across the track to the field inside]
[looks over his right shoulder, then faces forward again] You see that? Daynicuh Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!
Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left. [turns the steering wheel hard to the left and drives through the drivers' eating area and the pedestrians all running and screaming, Cartman ran over most of them and some survived by running from the side] Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang! "[Cartman made it back on the track]"
I'm back own the track. [An enraged Kenny makes his way down the bleacher steps towards the track. He jumps onto the track and lands on the Vagisil car. He turns around on the car roof and looks into the car through the windshield, Cartman also enraged as well] What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!
[irked] Get off my car, Kenny!
We're tradin' paint! [further down the track he hits two other cars, which then slammed into each other. Back to Cartman, he's furious] Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!
[determined and angered] Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brake! Bye Kenny. [steps on the brakes, launching Kenny at the end of the track]
Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck mah car.
Fuckin' gay as hell. [Patty pulls up to his left, taps him a bit, then pulls away.]
[Shocked] Oh, fuck my ass again! [...and crashes upside down into the outer wall. Patty goes onto the finish line, getting the victory for Jimmie Johnson]
No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. [Kenny is confused] I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.
[livid] The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!
Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!
You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
Oops, busted. [avoids eye contact]
Aw, crap, there's more of them?
You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!
[takes the ball from Kenny and confronts Kyle] Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.
Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!
So what?! That makes you from Jersey!
[turns around] He's from Jersey, you guys. [inches away] Let's just get away from him.
Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!
[takes off Kyle's hat] You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!
[moves Kyle aside] Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!
Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.
Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you. [walks away, then turns and glares at him] And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!
What the hell are you guys doing?!
[points to Kyle] And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could easily be a spy!
Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!
Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
[Whining] That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the treeee! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it! [Stan and Kenny walk away silently] Did you see the scratch, Keeenney?!
So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, "I'll smash your teeth in!" My head is all like gashed open.
I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler. [Kyle is cleaning his rifle nearby and lifts his head to see what the other boys are doing] Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh? [Kyle returns to cleaning his rifle. Cartman then moves to the opposite side of the circle] He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!
This is very serious, Butters.
Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?! [Kyle looks up again. Cartman notices and turns to look back at him] Hey, Kyle. [stretches] Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh. [turns around and goes into a low voice as Kyle watches from nearby] We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.
Come on, you guys, hurry!
I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!
[leads them to a spot] Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool. [stops] It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.
Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!
Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.
Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights! [the lights go on and the fourth graders Cartman was talking to earlier pop into view] Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! [the group of six come up and take Kyle away]
[stops Stan and Kenny in their tracks] Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us. [rushes up to the freezer door] Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.
Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!
You ginger Jersey Jew! [Snooki rises up behind him] Your tactics don't work on me!
[looks over his shoulder, then looks back at the other boys] Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?
What does it want?!
No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!
[Sniffling] Thank you, Kyle.
Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster. [Pinches Kyle's cheek] But you're my little monster.
So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. [laughs heartily. Butters approaches the table with a sheet of paper]
[voice rising in pitch] Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says "We need to talk" you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude.
I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?
I need to speak with him, please.
I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.
Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people, [sets his briefcase on the table and opens it] and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news. [takes out an application to join Coon and Friends and hands it to Hindsight] You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.
I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.
[waits a few seconds, then] ...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.
Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!
[gathers the form and puts it back in the briefcase] Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! [walks away]
[voice over] Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.
Asshoooles! [leaps out of window]
[sarcastic] Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. [the line moves forward and the boys enter to see... Randy as the school chef]
Lobster foam? [Stan shuts his eyes and buries his nose in his right hand] It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!
[on stilts, dressed as Ramsay] Oy! Bebebebebebebe.
Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!
[still dressed as Ramsay] What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!
Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!
Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys? [Bebe walks by, and Cartman jumps up to approach her] Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough! [laughs at her, and she walks off disgusted. Token walks by] Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Token? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich! [Token walks on, but is puzzled by Cartman's behavior. Cartman sees four kids playing four-square and jeers at them] Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads! [checks his iPad and starts pacing] Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps! [smiles. Craig comes up behind him] This is so awesome! [Craig taps him on the shoulder and Cartman turns around]
[stares at him for a second] What?
Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! [looks around again]
Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! [Craig looks off into the distance, surprised]
No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!
I left my charger at home! [the boys are still waiting] Fine! I'm gonna go home and charge my iPad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! [walks away angrily]
Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!
YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to FUCK me!
Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!
I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!
Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!
Toshiba Handibook??
Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!
[looks at her for a second] Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!
You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?! [everyone is now staring at the two of them] Just say so! Go ahead! Here! [pulls down his pants to moon his mom, who puts her hands over her mouth] Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!
[sniffles] But I told you I was sorry.
I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
[looks around for something to come back with] Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Mama.
[sniffles] Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?
Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED! [bangs at the dashboard with his fists]
Yes! She fucks me so hard!
Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!
At Best Buy.
Uh huh.
Yes!
No!
Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! [Dr. Phil crosses his arms]
Booooooo!
She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...
You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!
[suddenly bright with hope] An iPad??? [dances in his chair]
Whoa! Cooool! [struts over to it, then presses some icons on the iPhone on Junichi's forehead.] Oh wooow! No waaay! [walks to the iPad on the woman's ass and presses some icons there.] It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!
Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!
What?! Hey, that's mine!
Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me! [a bolt of lightning strikes Cartman and the power goes out]
What's this?
Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy! [runs up behind him, with the other three boys] Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!
Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!
Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy!
Ugh, let me talk to them. [walks up to the President Wulff]
Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. ["Look, this whole thing is a mistake."]
Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen. ["We don't care about the Comedy Award thing. It was the special education kids. They made us choose."]
Dürfen wir der Kind dort.. [walks up to Kyle] ...geboten? ["We can offer the child... here."] Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. ["He's a Jew. Eh? A handsome soft Jew. He's freeesh. And beauuutiful, beauuutiful."]
[sighs] Well, I tried.
Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on "Saturday Night Live"?
He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on "Nurse Jackie" and on "Rockin' The Boat."
Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!
Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler.
Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. [a burly guard stands by the door]
It's kind of funny, you guys.
[runs up to Funnybot and tries to pull him from the mainframe] Stop it now! Ugh- [is zapped enough to pull away. He turns and walks back to the boys] No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism.
Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?
Paradox...
[cryptically] Or will there be?
My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.
[storms into the cafeteria and walks towards the table] Goddamnit! [Butters sits back down] Who the fuck do they think they are?! [arrives and starts pacing back and forth] This is the last fucking straw! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!
[begins to rattle the table] I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL! [Butters groans as Cartman shakes the table. Cartman soon stops] This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone too far this time!!
No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time! [flies into a rage again and rattles the table] The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you! [the other boys look at each other] You remember the school physical we all took last week?!
Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
Yeah they fucking did Kyle!
Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!
Go look for yourselves!!
There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!
Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: "Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches"! [turns around and faces the other boys] Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!
No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!
Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!
[measures, then writes down the result on his notepad] Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches. [Clyde zips up and turns around] You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.
Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next? [Butters walks up and gets on the stool] Whip it out, Butters. [Butters drops his pants and briefs]
Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.
Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.
Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers. [walks towards the door with Butters, Token and Craig, but their way is blocked by Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.] What?
What, Kyle?
I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. [points to his measurement]
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead! [goes to get measured by his peers.]
There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4! [The two girls leave and Red walks by] What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care! [wanders about approaching random girls] Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!
Oh, Goddamnit!
Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!
For what?!
Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!
You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!
What?
Those weren't our dick sizes?
I don't know! Why would you?!
[gets off the chair and walks off] Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!
Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
Fuck you! No I don't!
Honestly, I wouldn't really care.
I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!
Why the fuck am I here?!
Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!
Oh, that's cool.
My penis is 13 inches long.
Yeah dude!
[takes his chair and swings it against a wall, where it shatters] Yeah!
Burn it down, dude! [Daniel demolishes boxes with a bat while Gretchen takes a pipe to other boxes. Michael kicks some boxes while Cartman takes a small hammer to a huge box. Wayne D fires away with a pistol while Chase fires away with a semi-automatic]
The Jews!
No, and fuck Kyle!
Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!
Wait, what?
Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!
I'm still fucking angry!
Oh. Hey Kyle.
I'm volunteering.
[firmly] I'm volunteering my time, Kyle.
I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?! [to the nurse] Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. [walks away]
Ah, crap! [rolls his eyes]
Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.
What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.
Crack baby basketball. [Kyle pushes his chair away from the table, gets up, and begins to leave] Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us! [Kyle reaches the staurs] We could actually really use you!
Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping. [Kyle heads downstairs] Dammit! [Kyle leaves the building; Cartman races down the stairs to catch up to him] Kyle, wait I- [Kyle slams the door shut and walks away. Cartman opens it and catches up to Kyle] Kyle, hold on a second!
What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!
We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. [Kyle stops walking, then turns around]
Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.
Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.
After you. [the other four enter.]
Come on. [the other boys follow]
We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.
Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.
We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.
Alright now, open presents! Open presents!
Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?
Yaaaay!
[eagerly opening his own gift] What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?
Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox! [Speed Zone for XBOX 360] D'you guys see that? Coool, huh?
Stan's getting another present, Mom.
Yaaaay! [rips the wrapper off] Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?
Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?
Turn it off dude!
Oh yeah, that one's cool. [gets into the rhythm] Yeah, this part's killer. [looks like he's exercising]
Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!
He's lying, dude. Hit X
What's that?
Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.
Look like ice cream to me.
...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. [Cartman and Kenny turn and walk away. Stan approaches Kyle]
Oh cool, the movie trailers!
That looks pretty good.
Stan, knock it off!
No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude.
Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! [he and Kenny leave. Kyle stays behind]
Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again! [at this point Stan stops and stands alongside the other boys, but he's still looking at the ground] But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!
Yep!
Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
Wait what?
Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?
You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!
Okay, you're on, Jew! [he and Kenny follow Kyle away. Several seconds later, the bus shows up and Stan gets on. He takes an empty seat and no one sits next to him. He leans against the window, looking very sad]
Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? [Stan is hearing everything as if from a distance]
That's right, it's a butt fungus.
Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
[coughing somewhat] Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.
Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!
I-I'll try. I'll try. [lays on his stomach. The nurse sees something under his pants and pulls them back.]
A what??
Are you serious? How can there be- [sighs] Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??
What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!
Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!
[rounds a corner and walks past Wendy and Kyle] Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!
[stops and backs up] I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!
Really?
Gee, thanks Kyle!
Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.
There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.
How are we doing on those patties, Jew?
Nice!
It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.
I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers. [Kyle may have noticed, but he doesn't say anything about the burgers stuffed down behind Cartman's ass and legs. Cartman goes into the booth, and moments later comes out with a fresh batch of finished burgers] Alright, these are good to go! [More kids have gathered. Among them are Esther, Heidi, Red, Bill, and Tommy.]
Everything alright here, Kyle?
We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier! [they walk back out and away.]
[turns around] Alright y'all, keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready. [spits something out, wipes his lips clean with the back of his shirt sleeve, and returns to patrolling the border] There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them!
Not now, Mom! We're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah! [turns to the boys on the ground - Clyde, Craig, and Timmy] All right patrol, you all know the drill. Not one Mexican is to get past this border! Not a single one! Yeehaw!
[robot voice] Scanning for Mexicans. [more sound effects] Oh! [He spots Kyle coming out of the woods] We've got a Mexican! [Clyde and Craig take up posts]
[to the other boys] He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid. [to Kyle] Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!
Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well you're a fuckin' Jew Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew! [Stan sneaks in past a cardboard box labelled "Christmas Ornaments"] Let's just see you try and-!
Clyde?! [descends from his perch atop the border and goes to Clyde] The fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through!
Ugh yeah?! Well you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit! [Token appears at the other end of the border and hops over] If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-!
Dude!! [walks over to Craig] How did he get past the fence, Craig?!
Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up! [Jimmy walks by in the foreground]
Oh God! [throws down his hat]
I'm not pouting! I've just heard all these jokes before!
At least I have an asshole, Kyle! [the boys laugh]
[talking in his sleep] No. NO! Must protect the border! Everyone's gettin through! No! Clyde! We're losing! Kyle go through! Oh no, now Stan's through! And Jimmy! It's over! The only Mexican left is Butters; we've got... [wakes up] Butters! [gets up, then tries to get the others up] Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers!
Where is Butters?
[puts on his ranger hat, now speaking in his Texan voice] All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through! [walks towards the woods, but stops long enough to tell Kyle] You haven't won yet! [smiles evilly and moves on] Game on!
You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.
You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.
Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?[The news come back on, with Cartman glancing at his TV, with Kyle also staring, as Stan continues glaring at Cartman]
Oh dude. Sweet.
This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.
Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.
[robot voice] No Mexicans detected. [normally] Huh, nothing.
Wait a minute, isn't that...
[squints his eyes] Oh no you don't! [takes Officer 2's sidearm and fires at Butters.]
That asshole is not getting across my border! [Butters either fails to see the open gate, or it was closed while Cartman was firing at him, because he starts climbing the fence. Cartman quickly gets down to intercept him, but decides that electrocuting the fence would get Butters off it, and it works]
[gives chase] No you won't Butters!
Ey!
¡Respeto mi autóridad! ["Respect mah authoritah!" Again, Cartman is fired upon, and his boat begins to sink. This time, the border patrol is in a helicopter firing away]
Where the fuck did he go?! [in the background, Butters can be seen riding by on his burro. Cartman sees him and gives chase. Just before Cartman reaches him, Butters blinks. Cartman jumps off his ATV and tackles Butters off his burro, and they both end up on the desert ground, with Cartman on top] Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose! [Butters apparently collapses] The fuck is this?! [instead of seeing the real Butters, Cartman sees a life-size piñata of him. The head separates from the body and candy falls out] No. NO! [Butters is climbing the fence]
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! [Butters goes over the border fence and jumps down]
I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!
[Sighs gruffly and rolls his eyes] A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...
YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys! [runs up to Butters, Kenny, Stan, and Kyle] You're never gonna guess what! [stands among them] Seriously you guys, guess what??
You guys, you know Pete Melman? [no one answers] Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class?
Yeah yeah, Pete Melman!
He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! [begins to cackle]
Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!
Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper? [whips out an iPhone and starts looking for the Eavesdropper article] It's a Web site about all the students in the school! [The web site screams "Exclusive! Pete Melman Craps Pants At School!" at you. Part of the page has a picture of Pete on there, with a 'play' button to play a recording]
Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys! [gets back to his phone] Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom. [touches the 'play' button] Just listen, listen listen.
Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it! [laughs. Craig moves on]
Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, "Poopypants Pete", but th- but then I also thought of "Mushpants Melman."
Oh Jesus, what now?! [goes to the office]
Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny! [slaps the table and laughs]
Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.
[smiles] Yeah, he killed himself.
Hey! Whoooa.
'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!
You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!
Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.
[scoff] Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done!
You aren't listing to anythin- [checks himself] Make it worth my while how?
Uh, hey Jenny. Sup?
Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?
So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. [takes out a box of cupcakes from his backpack]
I was just thinkin' that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of... [gulps] liked you.
I know. Ah I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake? [getting uncomfortable, he puts the cupcake in the box and the box away in his back pack] Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time. [walks quickly away]
[concerned, while Mr. Garrision is talking] You okay, Jenny?
Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class. [Jenny moans even more]
Ah, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class.
Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.
Oh my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants! [Millie, Token, and Wendy leave] Did you hear that?! [Kyle and Clyde leave] It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was!
WAY worse!
Alright, kewl.
You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! [shows them the story on his iPhone]
Nobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!
Jesus Christ! [thinks hard] Okay, okay. [squeezes his eyes shut, puts his hands over them, removes the right hand] Um, Jesus- [removes the left hand] ah... Okay, look. [the adults lean in a bit] Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?
Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you... [turns his head left for a moment, still hasn't opened his eyes] you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. [Victoria, Adler, and Mackey just stare at him]
Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here? [Mr. Adler looks at Principal Victoria, Principal Victoria looks at Mr. Mackey, Mr. Mackey places a call.]
Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.
Yeah, I think they're all ready.
It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.
Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?! [leaves the preparation table and faces them] I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now!
Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You [gasp] you actually got her to come! [grins]
No thanks. Okay, proceed.
That. Was. Amazing.
Boy, I say.
It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it.
Oh, you're most certainly welcome.
Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey?
[softly] I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those.
Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it. [Stan, Kyle, and some other kids are not amused]
Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. [Kenny climbs down and Kyle approaches]
Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?
Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.
Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.
Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!
Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!
Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.
I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.
What do you mean, Peter Panda?
Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! [slams a door, but it doesn't close. Cartman walks out]
Mom, have you been here all day?!
Somebody's been in my room! [she looks up at him as he goes back to his room. He looks under his things to see if anything is missing. His mom appears at the door] Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!
Am I sure?? Look at this place!
[turns around and glares at her] Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me! [goes back to searching his stuff and finds a watch] They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch... [finds a video game] My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have- [looks at a corner of his room. A chair set apart for Clyde Frog is empty, but his other four dolls are arranged and seated in from of it.] Oh my God. [panicking] Clyde Frog!
No. [goes to the corner and tosses his dolls aside, then looks up in despair] NOOO! [runs to his closet and looks in there. He doesn't find Clyde Frog in there] CLYDE FROG!! [stops to tell him mom] They took Clyde Frog! [runs out of his room. Liane is confused]
[calling out and walking around] Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?! [stops and notices something on a tree. It is Clyde Frog, nailed to a tree through his front paws and forehead. It's ripped all over and cotton pops out of the rips. Under the frog is the word "VENGEANCE" scratched onto the tree bark in red spray paint] Clyde. CLYDE FROG! [throws up]
I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers. [Stan and Kyle are falling asleep. Kyle rests his head on his left hand] And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, "I'm not getting away with this, am I?" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-
Got something to say Kyle?! [grips the sides of the podium]
How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle! [stops himself] Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. [a bagpipe player begins a tune. Two men lower the casket into the ground]
Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-
Fly bu-what?
[thinks a moment] Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...
Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ.
Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!
What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?
Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.
That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.
So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.
What the hell?! [the flames set his curtains on fire. He sees them next to his bed and stands up on the bed] Mom? Mom, my room is... [turns around and sees Peter Panda and his dresser on fire] AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!
[runs up] Don't you touch him! Leave him alone! [swats the doll out of the fireman's hands] Peter Panda!
Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!
[on all fours] Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!
This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.
Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.
What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?
Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.
Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me. [the alarm sounds. Cartman puts his chips aside and gathers his toys close] What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!
What?! Who?!
I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back! [Token looks out his window, Cartman leaves the bedroom]
Who's there?! [notices Token coming out behind him] Lock that door behind you, Token. [then shouts at whomever might be there] Black people live here! [some flood lights come on]
Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!
Oh sure!
Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader? [looks around] Oh shit! [drops the bat and runs back inside] I told you to lock that door, Token! [runs up to Token's room and searches for his stuffed toys] No. [sees the other four boys come in] Nononono! [grabs Kenny by the throat and shakes him] Where are they Kenny??!!
HAAAAGH! [runs out and closes the door, then locks it and runs off]
[returns] I don't trust any of you assholes! [to his dolls] Where are you sons of bitches?! [leaves]
Hello?? [lightning crackles outside and floods the kitchen in light for a moment] Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?! [sees a boiling crock pot, walks up to it and removes the lid. Inside he see the third...]
Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!! [more lightning crackles as he runs out of the kitchen.]
Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin! [walks towards the fireplace] Jesus Christ! [over the fireplace he sees Rumpertumskin drawn up by four chains and a bomb wrapped around his neck]
Who did this to you?!
Don't worry, I'll get you down!
AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER [begins to cry] Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??
Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! [Token, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny look down from the second floor]
They were your FRIENDS!
Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!
There's one problem. [walks up to the doll, takes the gun and walks back to where he was] You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.
Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!
[sobs for almost a minute, then aims the gun] Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you.
Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? [Sawitsky crosses his arms and is not all all pleased]
This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?
Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.
Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.
You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
[like a doorbell] Dumbass, it's November. [normally] The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.
Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?
Uh-huh??
Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?
Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? [he and Kenny raise their hands, then Stan raises his]
Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? [raises Kyle's hand]
Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.
See what I mean, you guys? [a black car with tinted windows pulls up at a corner within sight of the boys and the passenger window comes down and the agents inside look at the boys]
Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?
Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
Oh no. Oh NO!
Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! [turns around and leaves the kitchen]
You guys have stuffing?!
Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come! [Liane takes a shopping cart and follows Cartman to the right aisle. Cartman looks for the stuffing, but doesn't fine any. The attendant walks by] Hey! Where is it!
No!
NO!
Yeah, History Channel rules.
[curious] Ohhh??
[filming with his phone] Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence. [chuckles and waves with his left hand] Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave! [to his phone] That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.
[runs up to the other two with a memo pad] Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.
Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!
Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo- [noticing Craig coming into view] sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes. [as Craig passes by] Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? [stifles a laugh]
Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. [stifles a laugh]
This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
Eh yeah?
[laughs] Heh heh, yeah?
What?
[hops off his chair and moves off a bit, then gets a panicked look] Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.
[turns around and glares at Butters] Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew! [makes a fist, then crosses his arms] Well I won't give him the satisfaction!
Alright, let's hear it for Kyle! [claps] He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! Yeah, that's super funny, guys! [Stan and Kyle turn from their lockers to look at him] Laugh it up, everyone! [ends up by Stan and Kyle] Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!
That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! [runs away]
[sighs] Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.
Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!
Yeah, see, the problem, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kid in skewl!
[trying to get this straight] We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You can't just sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!
Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!
IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!! [runs off]
My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.
[comes down the stairs in a Hawaiian shirt] What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then. [walks over to the suitcases and grabs the handles] Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away? [turns left and begins to walk out] It's gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.
[sets the picture aside] Yeah, yeah.
That's right.
Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!
Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! [Mr. Adams doesn't look too happy]
A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!
How?!
Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!
Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?
Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.
What?? [looks out the window. A sign on the side of the road says "Welcome to Greeley, 'The Exact Opposite of Hawaii" Please drive safely" A crow stands on top of the sign] Greeley?
What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!
You're my new mom?
Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?
Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!
Oh heell naw! [yells into the hallway] Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM! [Mrs. Weatherhead walks in]
Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.
You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny! [Kenny walks up to a group of his new friends]
[moves past Kenny] Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!
Really?
[jumps for joy] YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!
Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom is so poor she only understands hand-OUTS. [laughs even harder]
I wasn't making fun of anybody.
I was just teasing.
My case worker? [looks over his shoulder and sees Mr. Adams walk in] Oh, not this guy!
Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking something topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!
Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!
I'm not saying it.
I'm not saying it!
Okay, fine! [turns to the camera] I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
[walks up] There he is, there's my buddy.
Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?
[begins to cry and walk away while Kyle stares angrily at him] Aww, my mom is so poor she walks down the road with one shoooe. [backs up] And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say "No, I found ooone."
[whistles] Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.
[puts his arm on Clyde] Of course, man. It's cool.
[imitating Clyde's mom] Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like "Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends! [He laughs, Butters joins him.]
Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.
I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.
Nuh-uh.
Mom, get the door! [Liane walks in to answer the door]
Who are these buttholes?
My potty? What are they going to do to it? [runs upstairs]
Hey, hey! That's my bathroom! [Liane follows him]
Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.
Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.
This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!
Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!
What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?
Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.
Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?
Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.
That's right.
Yeah.
That's right.
Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?
Oh boy, here we go.
So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like "Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!" And Clyde is all like "Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!" Dude, it was a riot.
Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
[his voice comes through the receiver] Clyde, you there? Hello? [Clyde comes off the toilet, flushing it. He waits for a few seconds, then angrily puts the seat up, and leaves the bathroom while flipping off his mother pointing upwards.]
Nice bolo tie, Stan.
Bolo ties are... [quickly glances at Kyle] really in right now. Cool you have one.
No, dude, it's... badass.
...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck.
You may suck our collective balls, sir! [they leave the store, turn right and walk]
I told you guys. I've been watching all day.
This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. [walks out]
[standing next to a covered mobile whiteboard] For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. [unveils the equation]
Dialog
Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!
Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-
[quickly analyzing the situation] Butters, what the fuck?!
"My arms hurt." Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! [Butters picks the sign up and resumes twirling]
Oh ahhhh, three bucks.
We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.
Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5 [actually 55-26177] This is-oh my God, look at this you guys. [shows off the ring Leroy sold him earlier] This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the rung just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?
YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?
Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?
Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.
Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought "Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!"
Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.
Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.
Suck my balls, suck my balls... [enters the store] Hello!
[shoves his briefcase to one side] Yeah, listen, I'm running a retail business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours.
I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings.
Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there.
And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.
How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.
[long pause] What d'ja say?
Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?
Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!
Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!
[to the receptionist] You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that- [a disturbing sight stops him in his tracks] Motherfucker!
[approaches the other boys] You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!
-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!
[in a wooden dark place with two wires on the ground] I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.
Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. [The agents run after them.]
Oh, please. Bradying is so 2000 and late.
[yawns] Oh, God. That was boring.
Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.
Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.
Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?
Really? [the boys excitedly run, except for Butters]
Yes!
What's it say, what's it say?
What? Let me see that. [the newspaper has Cartman's pictured and a headline 'Faith Hilling so 2,000 late']
Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?
You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. [shows three other guys' pictures]
I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage. [shows a couple of more pictures] This has to be stopped, you guys.
How is this Kyle? This good? [the boy moves away a bit. The other kids are stunned. The boys stand next to them, Kyle having an iPhone in his hands]
[continues moving as the other boy tries to get past him] Cool, these will be good uploads.
Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
Why don't you make me? [the boy punches him, Cartman responds by hitting him on the ground. Stan and Kyle begin to punch Boy 1 while Kenny attacks the girls.]
Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this? [Mr. Kitty looks at him] You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty. [closes his laptop and approaches Mr. Kitty] Bad Mr. Kitty. [Cartman hits Mr. Kitty with a stick. Mr. Kitty hisses, then paws at him.] Bad kitty! No more memeing! [walks away] Come on, guys. [the boys walk out of the room. Cartman turns his back to scold his cat again] Bad Mr. Kitty!
I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.
Dude, what's going on?
Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?
[holds him] Come on, Kyle.
It's okay, man, come on.
Get a couple facing the other way, brah. [turns the other way]
I know. I know Kyle. [stops lifting his "nipples" up]
I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change. [starts crying] The sun hurts my eyes. [wipes away his tears]
No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.
And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. [both of them sigh]
[he is doing a combination of Taylor Swifting and Cat Breading] Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?
No, kitty, you have to be quiet.
No kitty! That's a bad kitty! [Boy 1 and his friends come over]
[begins to crawl while holding Mr. Kitty] Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!
Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.
SHUT UP, KITTY!
Let's do this. [he runs to the hallway, where Kenny hands him Mr. Kitty. He goes to the stage with Mr. Kitty, and pulls down his pants as Stan is ready to record him. He then stops, thinking.]
[softly] No. NOO! [puts his pants back on] I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this. [puts down Mr. Kitty] And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. [he turns sideways and snaps his fingers a few times, then pulls up his shirt, Faith Hilling.]
[music begins to play]
We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.
Come on everybody,
Is a meme I will fight
Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?
Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? [Kyle stops and starts listening]
So interesting, wow. [he and Sheila are drinking tea]
Oh, hey, Kyle.
Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.
Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
Alright, Kyle, listen. [comes forward with Kyle, then sighs] Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.
All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever. [Cartman announces the special within the episode] "Cartman's Passover Holiday Special", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! [creepy music plays]
[anxious] Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.
Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.
Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...
[angrily points at him] Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!
[keeps the boys away] Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.
Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.
I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?
Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.
[standing on his bed with camera kit attached to him] Butters.
Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.
Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro! [Butters stammers a bit] I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.
Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.
Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.
You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ. [a rustle comes through the bush] Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING! [to Butters] He's here somewhere.
JESUS IS A LIE!
Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.
Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?! [Butters thinks] THERE IS NO CHRIST!
No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?
Sh! You hear that?
I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video. [connects his video camera to the TV] What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra. [moves away a bit] And you're the first to see it. [the video shot of Butters and Cartman from last night is played on the TV] This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this. [pauses] 'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for... [an abrupt rustle] right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again. [plays that moment again] Wait for it... wait... there! [pauses to show the motion blurred animal that moves between bushes] Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.
It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. [the president walks to the window. Employee 1 follows him]
We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. [points on the map]
That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! [drops in a pool, then comes out]
Now we head back to Colorado, here. [points on the map] We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.
People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.
These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!
I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.
Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.
Heh. What do you mean? [he is stunned]
Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?
Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.
Why?
There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real. [loud thunder] Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah. [quickly makes a call with his cellphone] Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real? [Kyle is listening to him in his bed with his eyes half-closed] I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?
Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? [Kyle hangs up and goes back to sleep. His phone rings again, causing him so throw it to the wall.]
Jesus loves me this I know
[voice only] Guys?!
Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!
[in the church] What? What was that? Butters? Token?! [the door is forced] Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh! [quickly hides between the candle stands] You guys?! GUYS!
It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
Wingstreet?!
Dude, I want wings! [there is some knocking on another door] Ahghgh!!! [it turns out to be Mr. Billings and his two employees.] Oh Jesus, it's only you!
HUH?!
Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!
OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME! [Employee 3 brushes his face with the blood of a chicken which is in the bucket he holds] What the-?
This isn't safe or fun!
NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!
[smiles] Kyle! Hey, Kyle! [Kyle looks at him with his eyes half-closed] I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.
Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble! [Kyle frowns and walks away] No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money! [softly] Oh God, what am I doing? [shouts] I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke! [softly] Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.
It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome. [he is peeked by a pair of red slanted eyes with a snoring effect.] I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! [the pair of eyes turn out to be binoculars used by Bobo.]
Bobo?! Bobo, no! [Bobo fires a dart] Wha- [falls over]
[seems to be having a dream] Ugh... what... where...
Ugh... what? [stands up] What's going on?
It's raining frogggggsss! [finds Kyle, who is clinbing to the roof of his house on a ladder] Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?
So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.
Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.
What does that mean?
Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?
You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! [Kyle gets angry]
Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?
But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.
Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. [a bloody frog lands over the edge]
But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.
I love you, dad.
And our love grows
Have no fear, for God is near
No, Kyle! I don't believe you!
Noooo! [goes inside somewhere, but sees two kids with bloody eyes]
Noooooo! [runs past a mom and her child]
Noooo! [he is confronted by a man]
No! The bread's all flat! No! [shoves the bread down and keeps running] Aaaaahhhh! [the Pharaoh has kneeled down. All children around him have their heads explode. Screaming and shouting can be heard in the background]
We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! [his head explodes, and the Pharaoh crys in despair]
[sleeptalking] No! No! The bread is all flat! No!
[offscreen] I'm alive! [everyone stops. Cartman runs in, gasping for air.] I'm alive, you guys. [holds a blond girl though her shoulders] I don't know how, but I'm alive! [lets go and keeps running] Can you believe it? It's a miracle. [runs to the stage] Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.
Hey guys, listen! [nobody cares. He finds Kyle standing there, approaches him, and lets out a deep sigh.] I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.
I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.
Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!
Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all "my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that." But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay? [the boys ignore him and continue eating] See? You can't remember.
He has a point.
I have balls.
Still balls.
[tarted up, takes over and backs up the stairs]
[takes over at the corner and backs up, pointing at his own crotch]
'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. [nearby, Craig and Clyde take notice]
We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! [blows a raspberry at him]
The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
Somebody help us! [motion blur back to opening shots]
Kyle, hurry! [a shot of Stan with Kyle]
[inside a van, in a window seat] Oh God!
Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.
Look at his lip. [to Kenny] You've got herpes, dude.
No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.
Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!
Ziplining. Hell yeah.
[being interviewed] We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.
Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him. [leans over to see how close his finger can reach without touching] Zi- [Kenny puts his right mitten over his mouth and Cartman pulls his left hand back playfully] Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross.
Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister. [laughs] You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.
Alright!
[being interviewed] Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. [the benches are rearranged so the zipliners can watch a TV screen above them]
...No.
Finally!
Well, come on, we don't have a choice. [leads the others to the shuttle van.]
Mmmm, no?
The trees' biology?
Yeah. [Michael shortens the strap between Cartman and the zipline, and holds him up]
Yeah.
Zipliiine. [Michael sends him on his way]
Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!
Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!
[being interviewed] "The next zipline? What are you talking about?"
NOOOO!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [opening shots return]
[on his way down a zipline.] I'm so fucking bored! [Hour 3 arrives. Michael sends the next zipliner on down. The others cheer her on]
We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
Yeah you! In the park this morning?! "I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!"
I brought it up because you already brought it up!
Fuck you Kyle!
Nnnn-mo...
Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! [keeps sipping the Double Dew]
This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew. [at the bottom of the can is a blurb saying "DEW THE MATH!"] Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.
If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!
NOOO! [opening shots return]
[still aching] Eeeeugh.
Uh oh. [lets out a wet fart]
A marina?
Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!
Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!
No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!
You?!
[points at Stan] You... You killed Kenny! [Stan begins to weep]
[being interviewed] It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.
You came for us!
[being interviewed] We were saved. It was over.
[being interviewed] No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.
[being interviewed] It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. [takes a long sip]
What?
[taking control of the situation] Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.
Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked? [Token looks over at him. The girls start practicing] Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you.
Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?
[confused] What the? ...Oh, Token's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.
[fairly whispering throughout, beginning when Mr. Garrison mentions Lord Stark. He sits between Token and the new girl and grins as he looks at each of them by turn] Dude... Token! [jerks his head a bit in the girl's direction and points at her] Token. Dude. [Token looks at him, then goes back to taking notes. Cartman smiles] Psst. Token. [points to the girl again, but puts his right hand up so she doesn't notice. Token is annoyed] Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.
...Token. You want me to pass her a jelly bean?
Huh?
Ah, he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis. [begins to laugh at his own joke] Right guys? [tries to hold the laugh in]
[quickly looks at the girl and at Token] Token. [leans back in his seat so Token has a clear view of the girl] Dude, dude. Dude.
[approaching] Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?
[motions to his left] Just, can I talk to you, real quick? [walks the girls over to the end of the hallway] What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?
Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.
Yeah, of course. [the girls look at each other]
Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?
Thanks, you guys.
WHAT?! KYLE?! [the girls don't hear him]
Motherfucker! [gets up and runs off]
Hey, ah, Nichole, right?
Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here? [takes her to another set of bleachers nearby] Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?
Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know. [fakes a sweat] Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know ...together?
Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it sucks, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.
Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.
Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. [snaps his fingers and walks away]
Psst Butters. Butters! [Butters stops and notices, then walks over to Cartman] At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.
[takes off his shades] Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married.
No no. [walks him towards the camera] Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.
Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! [the boys make a break for the front of the school and exit the front doors]
[hiding in the bushes, weeping silently] Oh my God, sooo cute.
[sweetly] Ohhhhh my God.
You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me. [tickles the little cupid]
I see the questions in your eyes
Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. [behind him, on the merry-go-round, are Stan, Kenny, and Butters. Stan and Kenny are playing with a ball.]
I don't know, it's just so... perfect. [Stan and Kenny resume playing]
Kyle, Jesus Christ!
Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?
Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!
Oh! Oh, I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez? [points to a Hispanic couple riding play elephants] Is it a coincidence they ended up together?!
Oh did they? I hadn't heard about that.
Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.
Nothing.
Nobody.
Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are! [can't fault him there. Nichole giggles again. Kyle looks defeated] Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!
Come on! [pounds on the door some more] Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry it up in there?! [pounds on the door some more. The door opens and Cupid Me floats out]
Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!
That's- Oh, oh, Cupid Me! [covers his nose with his bath robe] Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!
Dude, at least flush the toilet! [walks over to it] Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.
You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! [tries to catch Cupid Me, but Cupid Me keeps away]
I'm gonna get you! [chases Cupid Me out of the bathroom]
I almost got you! Almost! [Liane walks out of her room with clean laundry, and there's no sign of Cupid Me]
Everything's great, Mom. [to the invisible Cupid Me] No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! [dances away]
[crying inconsolably, sometimes sneezing into a tissue] It's not fair! They were so... happy!
It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
No, they won't!
No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!
And you! I should have never believed in you!
[grabs the imaginary cupid] I never wanna see you again! [hurls it into his closet door. It flies low. Cartman gets out of bed, grabs a bat that's conveniently leaning against his bedroom door, and bashes the cupid over and over] Take! Your sunshine! And fuckin'! Die! [puts the bat up against the door and crawls back into bed. Butters takes Cartman's hand again and Cartman resumes crying]
That's right... That's right! [runs up to his room, goes into his closet and digs through his stuff until he finds the shoe box he put Cupid Me into after whacking him almost to death. He takes off the lid] Ohhh. [Cupid Me is shown laying face down battered and bruised, with a dry blood stream still near his mouth] I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.
Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.
Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. [tickles the cupid]
Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.
Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.
Denver Nuggets game?
[dolly zoom] NOOOOOOO! [runs away quickly]
Nooooooo!
[running into the center] NOOOOOOO! [triggers an alarm]
No time! NOOOOOOO!
Attention! Attention please! [Kyle and Nichole are surprised to hear his voice. Cartman is on the MegaTron] This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it! [Token is surprised to see Cartman there too, but Craig and Clyde are unfazed] Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands! [Nichole begins to take this in] Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. [Kyle is getting pissed off]
I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
That's right, Butters.
Yeah, you know what? [removes his bra and throws it to the floor] Screw this!
That's true.
[puts his bra back on] Let's do this. [turns his back towards Stan] Stan, hook up my bra.
Who needs a coach? We have Butters.
Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.
Hey Butters, you got a minute?
I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.
No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.
...I don't have a dad.
Youuu save it all?
Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?
Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.
[analyzes some more...] Holy shit I think I do.
That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.
That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
[looks over his left shoulder] Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? [looks at the gloves again]
[turns left to address Kyle] I'm not fat, Kyle.
Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like [that] bitch! [they see a scooter rolls past them with an obese man on it]
See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
[eyes some Oreos and goes for them] Oh my God you guys, look at this! [grabs a box and reads it] Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling. [closes his eyes and looks up joyfully] Holy hell yes!
Yeah... Yeah, here you go. [walks over, tosses them into her basket, and walks away with his head down]
Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?
[walks in] I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart. [stops] You're right Kyle. I'm fat. [sighs] All these years you tell me and me saying "No, I'm big-boned" or "no, that's just muscle"... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.
[turns around] No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it. [walks out of the house. Kyle is puzzled. Moments later, Cartman returns on a Rascal and rolls on into Kyle's living room] Sweeeeeeeeeet!
Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. [begins to ride in a circle around Kyle]
[stops] Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. [rides away]
[reaches the restroom and tries to get it, but the base is too wide] Hmm. [tries again. Kyle catches up] I can't. [tries again] I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. [tries again]
Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle. [tries again] You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. [tries again]
That's not the way this country works, Kyle. [tries again] Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter. [tries again] It's the law.
[tries again] Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible. [tries again] I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit. [backs out and prepares to leave] Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. [rolls away. Kyle looks on angrily]
["Nobody understands how embarrassing it is to live with obesity." He rides past a couple] Out of the way. Out of the way please. ["Wherever you go, you're treated differently" He arrives at a Denny's]
Coming through. Oh how humiliating. [now at the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland: "But even at Disneyland I get reminded of my weight." He rolls into the short line] Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel. [reaches the front of the line] Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have- [finds a line of other scooter riders in front of him] Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!
Yeah, well you got skinny arms! [Later on, Cartman rolls through Cnderella's Castle. "And then even Disneyland can't take away the shame, as all the people suffering from obesity are ignored. Like, we're invisible." A woman's baby carriage gets in the way and she quickly pulls it back as Cartman rolls towards the exits] 'Scuse me. Move it.
And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy? [chokes up and begins to sob] At Besty Buy I'm sorry. [At the defense table sits a Best Buy employee, looking around] To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom? [reaches for a long-handled grip with his left hand, then uses it to take a tissue from the judge's bench. He grabs the tissue with his right hand and lowers the grip, then blows his nose] Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?
Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. [facing him is the rest of the fourth grade class]
What, Kyle?! [the device then collapses and puts itself away]
[rolls up to him] You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!
Oh! Oh, did you hear him?! [rolls back to the workers] This is exactly what Adele is talking about! [begins to pace back and forth] Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle! [rolls up to Kyle] Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day [rolls away] to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers! [rolls back up to Kyle] You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look! [rolls to the far end of the gum] I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!
Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. [gets off the Rascal]
It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!
Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer! [the lawyer appears outside the office and tries to enter, but can't. The lawyer is on his own Rascal] As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!
What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
[begins riding around] I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! [turns around and rides out of the office]
[making 8's with his Rascal and itching for a fight] You're goin' down, bitch! [also in attendance are Butters, Stan, Kevin, and Craig] Nobody takes my ratings!
I'm pissed!
Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!
I ain't done with you, bitch!
[amid some ows and grunts] Oh! You fucking bitch! [Michelle Obama finally punches him off his Rascal. She picks it up over her head, then smashes it into the ground, breaking it. She then kicks Cartman in the stomach for good measure.]
Dude, no way!
[Walks up to him] Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?
Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?
No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? "Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight." It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!
Oh no, really?
Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!
What-what do you mean?
Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!
Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!
Oh fuck. [Goes to the touchpad by the door to shut it off] Oh what's the- God damn it! [The phone rings and he goes to answer it. He puts his left index finger in his left ear to hear from the right ear better] Hello?
Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!
Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew. [Thinks a moment] No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.
Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.
Sorry about this.
'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean "That's all right"! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!
[Liane appears at the top of the stairs and becomes coming down, but stops to hear what Eric is saying] That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!
[His mom goes back up the stairs] I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!
You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it? [closes and locks the door, then arms the system, then goes to the phone to wait for Wolf Home Security to call. The cat burglar pounds a window until it gives way and he goes in. The alarm goes off a second later. Cartman gets pissed off when the burglar breaks a second window and there's no response from Wolf. Finally the call comes in, and Cartman answers it] Hello?
[The cat burglar appears as he goes towards the stairs. He then stops] Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom. [Softly, to the cat burglar while muffling the mic] Go go, she's upstairs. [The cat burglar heads up the stairs] Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!
Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!
He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!
Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out! [Looks at the phone] The fuck?!
[stops] Who is there?
Oh?! Ohhh?! [backs away quickly. The phone rings, but Cartman goes to the kitchen to answer it] Yes? Yeah, hello?
A man just broke into my house and is- [looks at the phone] Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!
Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!
Heh- hello?
No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!
Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!
Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!
Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! [slams the phone on the floor]
[runs up to them] HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! [wears a little sign on his head showing that ]
Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.
Oh, fat bitch, huh?! [gets smug] Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!
What? [his alarm goes off, then he gets the call] Hello?
Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.
Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.
No, "uloveboobs." Lower-case u love boobs.
My password is uloveboobs!
You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!
Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-! [notices Kyle is gone, but looks around] Kyle? God damn it.
[in the perfume section of a store, with a saleswoman behind the counter] Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.
[outside a store] God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards![Martin is swamped with calls. Another one comes in] Hello? [his own INsecurity has gone off]
[in Bane mask] It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. [the men return in Bane masks to haul the agent out and beat him up]
FELLAS! Fellas!
You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!
Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! [The other boys get concerned and leave their tables to go to the restroom]
Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? [Kenny flashes an angry look]
...Wow.
Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. [The other boys gather around him]
Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.
He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. [Kenny sighs and walks away with his head down.]
We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.
Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?
Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.
[walks off with Kenny] You'll just have to wait and see.
[dressed as Hulk, comes in from the kitchen] Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!
This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!
Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, "Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!" [they head for a house to their left. Kenny rings the bell. A man opens the door holding a bowl of candy.]
[dropping his pose] I'm not Bruce Vilanch!
The Incredible...
No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!
The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!
[loses his cool and shuts his eyes] JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY! [moments later they're on to the next house] It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! [Kenny rings the door bell. A man opens the door holding a bowl of candy.]
That's right!
Dude dude dude! Check it out. [points to something across the street... a robbery in progress. One robber is outside a Kum & Go minimart. He breaks a surveillance camera with a crowbar, then jimmies the door open and goes in]
[turns around] You guys, we've gotta stop it!
Cartman SMASH! [they turn around and go into action]
[roars some more, then] Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind. [walks to the counter and sees a dead clerk slumped over the counter] Holy shit, they shot this guy!
Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!
[upset] I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.
All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?! [begins to roll up his sleeve, but then] Oh, hold on. [takes off his jacket and lets it drop to the floor] Aah, let's see... that one. [the same yellow one the others are having cut off. She cuts that one off] Stupid fraud! [spits onto the band] Good riddance to YOU! [picks up his coat and puts it on, walks off, and another man replaces him. The pharmacists adds Cartman's wrist band onto the others]
Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!
Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?! [Stan sighs and steps forward, turns right and walks away] What's wrong with him?
Uh huh.
So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times. [reaches his locker and opens it, then notices Stan. Butters walks over to Craig and another boy.] Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a "What Would Jesus Do" bracelet!
The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!
Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!
Craig?! You asshole!
[meets the first group] Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?
Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!
...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.
[steps up] Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.
...Fuck! Dude, weak. [the town is covered in scauses and looks like a Dr. Seuss town]
Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?
MOM!
She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.
Mom? Where's my mom?
[wriggles in his seat and laughs] "Warm nuts", she said.
Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!
[breaks into a smile and laughs] No way dude. No way.
MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!
Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old. [both passenger and attendant frown at him]
MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!
[from the Cartman kitchen] Hey Kyle. What's up?
Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society. [Kyle glances at Ike.] Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.
Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.
You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?
Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? [beams]
What if I did, Kyle?
Pretty sweet, huh?
What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.
[walks up to a stack] Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle. [holds up a ballot] Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. [tears the ballot in two, lets the pieces fall, and fakes a shocked face]
[Walks over to another stack] Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. [tears up that ballot]
Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.
Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.
Thanks Mom, [she leaves] I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.
[strokes his chin] Hmmm, no.
I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.
Ey! You can't do that! Ey!
I know my rights! Stop right now! [Kyle and the officers go in... and find nothing]
I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.
But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. [Kyle turns right and runs down the stairs]
Mm, mhm, mhm.
They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.
Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?
Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.
So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.
Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. [takes out a small ball-shaped bomb, smashes it against the table, and disappears in the resulting smoke.]
Butters. [Butters jumps up and is wide awake] You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?
I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.
Shhh, it's okay, Butters. [brings forth an M&M bag and opens it] Nobody's gonna find the election ballots. [pulls out a blue almond M&M.] I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look. [places the M&M in Butters' mouth and closes it] A place in town people barely even know exists.
Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!
Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!
I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!
I want a part in the new movies!
I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.
Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.
Haha.
Haha. [and a new partnership is formed.]
[on a tauntaun] I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers! [police cars show up]
Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?
No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! [the Chinese, the police officers, and the boys all hold hands around the bonfire and begin to chant]
[walks up to them, talking to someone on the phone via speaker] Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life.
Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like "Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!"
Yeah, but I was like "I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle." In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
[softly, covering the phone] Kyle, this is a private conversation.
Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.
Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?
Who is that? Is that Toby
Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?
You're what? What, you say?
I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore! [he's not talking to his friends at the table, but to his friends on the conference call] Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read "1984"?
See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally! [Kyle takes the top bun off his burger]
That'd be what?
I know, right? [Kyle puts the bun back on the burger, then takes his tray with him and walks away] A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages! [having lost his appetite, Kyle throws his food away, puts his tray on the nearby cart, and walks off. Cartman approaches the trash can] I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now. [carelessly throws his trash away, with fries spilling onto the floor, puts his tray carelessly on the card, then walks off behind Kyle] I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know? [Kyle stops, his anger rising] Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my "Stop Listening To Me" Web site. [turns on the video feature on his phone and starts recording] What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret! [ends the video and goes back to his phone friends. Kyle leaves] You guys gonna update your blogs too?
Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?
Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?
Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms. [Kyle just walks up to Cartman and stands next to him]
Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle! [runs off, then stops and addresses everyone on the playground] Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school
That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle? [walks away. The other kids disperse and go back to what they were doing. Only Butters and Kyle remain.]
Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.
Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, "you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek." I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?! [pounds the keyboard with his right fist. The other kids begin to star at him] This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core!
Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter.
No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna- [gets suspicious] Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence. [hides behind his monitor for a moment, then slowly stands up on his chair] I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room. [sits down] Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter.
What, they already have something better than Twitter?
No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?
["Alright, what's up everybody, what's up? I'm about ready to go to the NSA undercover, and see if I can expose some of those secrets." When Cartman appears, Kyle stops. "You can follow me on my Shitter account at #keepyourgovernmentoutofmybusinessdotcom. Wait, sh, I've gotta be careful. Kyle is here and I'm pretty sure he's tryin' to listen in."]
[walks up to Kyle. "Kyle, if you wouldn't mind, this broadcast is for my Shitter followers only." Clyde and Stan join them]
[leans towards Clyde. "Don't know if you've heard, but the government is actually able to monitor all our e-mails and Twitter accounts." leans towards Clyde. "With Shitter I don't even need a cell phone. My thoughts are sent directly to the Internet, and then to everyone else on Shitter."]
[leans towards Stan. "Yes. Now as I infiltrate the NSA, I'll be able to broadcast everything to all my Shitter followers."]
Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy.
Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.
["Oh cute. I'll have to try it out sometime, lol."]
["Wow, that's kewl. She's cute. ;) emoji"]
Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?
Bill Clinton.
Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.
I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.
[clears his throat as a distraction] I was um, sure that the appointment was today.
Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.
["Four sixteen pm. The chief asked me to join him as he went to question the possible suspects. I agreed to go along. Hopefully, the NSA has no idea of my secret intentions." The chief looks at him. "lol." The chief focuses on the road again. Moments later they stop in front of a house and get out of the car. The chief knocks on the door and a hippie answers it.]
["I've done it. I've infiltrated the NSA, and gained their trust." A shot of Alec Baldwin and his date at a buffet restaurant. The camera pans across until it reaches the couple. "So far, I've not ascertained how they were able to keep track of everyone in the country, but I'm close. Very close. I just hope that I'm not found out as a whistleblower before I'm able to expose their entire operation."]
Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?
Really? How big is my file?
Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.
Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to "ripped and sweet." [no one listens. He stands up on his desk] 'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status!
Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!
The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!
[runsn to catch up with the chief] Can't do anything?? You're the NSA!
I don't know.
Get their hands on what? [the chief presses some keys on the keypad next to the doors, and the doors open] Dude... [Santa is shown suspended in midair by a harness. Cables go from Santa to the surrounding wall of computers, and a massive one is attached to his privates. Several techs stand on a platform circling the room, looking at some of the many computers present]
You think I'm fat and unimportant now?! [rips off his fake mustache] I AM Eric Cartman! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin's new television show, via Shitter!
["Your secret is out, NSA! And now that everyone knows what you're doing to Santa you can kiss your program goodbye!"]
You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!
[through his tears] It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine!
Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?! [cries hard now]
It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa! [weeps some more]
I do toooo!
Okaaay. [she walks out and Cartman calms down] I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.
...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?
[walks away, then stops] It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.
What's this?
I can be forgiven?
For everything bad I've ever done?
And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?
[wipes his forhead and sniffs] Thta's pretty kewl.
I do, I love my country!
I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
Boooo! [Wendy looks up and gets angry] Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo!
Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy.
Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo! [Wendy lowers her report down to her sidee-] Boo Wendy! Liar!
I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.
That's more like it.
Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?
You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.
Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!
You guys? [Stan and Kyle turn to face him. He's at the end of the hall] You guys, you'd better get over here.
Butters' dad killed his mom. [Stan and Kyle look at each other in disbelief]
Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too! [the kids clamor for a few seconds]
And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!
Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo.
Alright, we've gotta do something.
Something he said. Did you hear him? He said "Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!"
You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.
Son of a bitch! [grabs Corey by the collar] Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!
Hey Token! [walks up to Token] What's up, bro?
"Nothin'" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks. [sniffs] Everything good with you?
Sweet. [Jimmy walks over and Cartman notices him] Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'?
Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Token. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President. [Jimmy walks away and Token is done at his locker] About time. [Stan and Kyle stop to watch]
Dude, um, what are doing after school, Token? You wanna, you wanna hang out? [Token puts one last book in before closing his locker]
God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess. [makes a fist with his left hand and straightens out his arm toward Token] Fist bump. Fist bump, bro. [Token reluctantly makes a fist with his right hand and bumps Cartman's fist with it. He leaves, and Cartman moves on in a happy mood, stopping by Stan and Kyle]
Yeah, I feel great. Why? [looks back] You think something's wrong? [moves on, not smiling]
Mister! [Herbert Garrison turns around] No! Stop, Token, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad Pitt! [wakes up violently and looks bewildered. Token is stunned, and Herbert Garrison, with his arms crossed, is not pleased.] Hey Token. What's up, bro? [makes a fist and extends it towards Cartman] Fist bump? [Token is unmoved and upset]
It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.
He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.
But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!
No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse.
M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay.
M'kay.
No, Token! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Token, Token!
Hey Token? How are you doing?
That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends. [puts his left fist forward] Fist bump. [leans to his left a little] Fist bump. [Token closes his locker and hurries away]
No! My wife, Token! Token, that's my wife!
No Token! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO! [wakes up]
Agreed.
Hoh boy, here we go.
[after a few seconds] Token, I wasn't on that jury. Okay?
This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.
I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem? [pulls out his poem and begins] It's called "I Was Not The Bullet." [clears his throat]
It's going to rhyme, Token, just hold on.
Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.
It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.
Black people say He-ey! [Token and Nicole stay quiet] Cool. White people say Ho ho! [Token and Nicole begin to get mad]
Black people say Hey hey hey! [no reply] Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say "I don't blame the white people. No no no!"
Token, calm down.
Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! [throws his mic down and runs off]
Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! [runs inside his house] Mom it's starting! We've gotta go! [runs up to his room and opens a drawer. He rifles through it looking for something] Come on, come on! [finds a red safety box with "BRAD PITT SURVIVAL GEAR" printed on the lid and on the panel under the clasp. He opens it and pulls out a gun and a Brad Pitt costume. He puts the costume on, takes the gun, and runs out into the street] Come on, we've gotta move! It's spreading! Let's go! [nearby, a couple is on their front lawn. The man is trimming bushes while his wife is shoveling snow by the front door.]
[frantically] Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow!
Get to an airport!
We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!! [she presses the pedal and takes off]
The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! [enters the tunnel]
Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go! [Nelly's Mom rushes into the plane. Three black security guards appear] Oh my God! [closes the plane's door and locks it. The guards try to get in, but Cartman holds the handle down with all his might]
The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now! [the plane takes off moments later]
The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!
You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to! [the passengers all take their seats.]
Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. [points to the island on a map.]
Everyone quiet! I have to think!
I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. [heads off to the restroom. He sees the "vacant" sign and opens the door, only to see a black man on the toilet]
Nah! [shuts the door and jumps back, then throws everything he can at the door so the occupant can't exit]
[running back to his seat] One of them is in the back!
Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!
It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.
His name is Token.
I won't do it! He used to be my friend!
[sighs] Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.
We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!
[takes her hand] Come on! [they leave the crash site]
Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes! [walks up to the counter] I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.
A person. [Nelly's Mom looks around]
Threatening all of us!
What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!
Stand my ground?
Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!
[walks away from the counter] This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid rules?! [his eyes light up] Wait a minute. I can't shoot Token, [turns around] but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?
The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!
Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go![the plane takes off. Once in the air...] Find the closest airport in Florida! [injects himself with something]
If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left! [everyone sits down] Black guy in the back! [the plane crashes into the Everglades. Cartman and Nelly's Mom make it out of the wreckage] Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.
Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out. [hands her a black sweater, which she puts on as she walks onto the roadway]
I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.
Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black.
Hey Token. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now.
Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry.
Uh oh. [brings forth a can of red spray paint and paints a red circle around himself in the middle of the street] Sounds like you're still angry, Token.
Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea. [makes a fist with his right hand and puts it forth] First bump? [Token stays put] Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person. [Token walks up to the red circle, then bends forward and offers his left fist. Then he steps into the circle and Cartman quickly shoots him]
That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine. [drags Token's body into the circle] Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it. [smiles when no one answers.]
Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.
Yeah. So bad.
Jury found me innocent, Kyle!
You interrupt people when they talk.
Oh man! [walks out of the room]
Oh boy.
Yeah Token, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.
Token, calm down.
Oh God, here we go again! [runs out of the office in a panic]
That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.
That sucks, dude.
I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.
[walks in] Hey, everyone? Excuse me! [the other kids start to turn towards him] Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up. [finally has everyone's attention] Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.
I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller? [a ginger boy with dark red hair leans to his left for a better view] Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.
[crosses his right arm over his chest and points to the doors behind his left shoulder] Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?
There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. [The camera turns right and stops at a cow with a Jewfro, glasses, a freckled face, and huge red polka dots on her body. Cartman laughs at his cleverness]
[giggling to himself] You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again!
Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it! [Butters and Kevin take their phones out...] I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature! [Jimmy takes out his phone...]
What? What joke? This is real!
No, [drops down to the ground] no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.
Thank you, Butters! [laughs to himself]
Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.
Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. [walks away]
[to a reporter] Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, "Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it."
I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. [chuckles loudly]
Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?
I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.
I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said "No." I owe you an apology and, I mean it.
[shakes his head] No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!
But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank? [no reply] Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.
You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! [picks up the house phone and starts punching]
[gasps loudly] Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??
Ohh my God! [whips out his camera phone and feigns concern] Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?
[reaching his locker] Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. [opens his locker and puts a book on top of the stack. Stan, at his neighboring locker, notices]
[puts another book on the stack] Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework, [puts a third book on the stack] gave me the soda from his lunch. [removes the second and third books he just placed on the stack] I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East. [places the third book back on the stack] Right, Kyle? [puts the second book back in the locker]
Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?
You what??
[walks up to him] Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle. [Kyle does so, and Cartman backs up onto Kyle's face] Let's see what I can muster up here.
Let's see. Oh! Oh! [farts, then gets off Kyle]
[enters and clears his throat] Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?
[small gasp] Kyle, are you sure?
Well alright. [farts into his left hand and cups it over Kyle's mouth, making sure the fart goes all the way in.]
Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?
I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?
You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? [three quick farts]
Huh? You comin'? [three more quick ones]
Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. [leaves, screen right. Kyle stands up]
Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?
Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.
Small penis?!
No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.
No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.
Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? [puts his hand on his ass and farts on it, then puts whipped cream on it, with a cherry on top, and smothers it on Kyle's face. He then walks away. A few seconds later, the cherry falls off]
Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.
Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.
Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick [Kenny plays with the hair on his wig and mumbles coyly]. Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.
What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we can get the new gaming system.
I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.
It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!
On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together! [pounds the table with his left fist] ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.
[walking around, surveying his knights] Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.
[flatly, but sternly] They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.
Okay, we need to start immediately, please. [clears his throat and reads] Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!
But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?
Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.
Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?
What do you mean?
Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.
We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! [the boys cheer this good news]
That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.
[chortles] What?
...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.
That's right.
We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!
Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!
[thinks for a moment] Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!
[walks up to Kyle] Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality. [turns around and walks away with the XBox group, with Kyle joining him. A shot of the mall as day turns to night]
Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?
[to Clyde] God these guys are such dorks!
[performs the Vulcan sign for goodbye] Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?
[to Clyde] Oh my god they're so gaaay! [to the Trekkers] Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap.
The Federation has agreed to fight with us! [the group gathers at a round table] With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size! [Kyle sadly nods in acknowledgement] You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?
You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances.
[with his right hand over his nose] Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.
What new Elmo doll?
Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.
I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever... [picks out a yellow rose and gives it to Kenny] switch sides, [Kenny sniffs it] it could make Stan's army problematic for us.
True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours. [stops and faces Kenny] Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.
You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?
Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!
Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners! [walks further along to Kyle, who's sitting on a tree stump.] Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?
Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.
Alright, stop, stop, stop! [leaves his chair and walks up to Scott and Butters] This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! [swings his staff at Scott's mouth and lands it, making Scott's tongue go back in his mouth]
There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! [leaves]
The men are just inexperienced, Sir Kyle. They need more training.
That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him! [they go through the sliding door] I said, "You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!" [reaches his refrigerator and opens it, looking for something to consume]
[turns around, holding a glass of milk] I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru! [takes a swig of it] Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game. [leaves, forgetting to close the refrigerator door]
Stupid asshole! [looks at a picture of himself and Kenny at Casa Bonita putting their arms around each other, with dreamy expressions, as they used to be best buds. He folds it up and lays it on his desk, face down] Yes, hello. I'd like to speak to the president of XBox, please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard. [lost his patience] Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone!
Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick.
Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him. [picks a rose out for Butters, just as he did for Kenny before.] How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones?
Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?
So what happens when the dragons show up?
Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.
Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
[shoots back] Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!
Why don't you mind your own business?!
Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.
It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army [picks a rose out for Kyle], but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation. [Kyle sniffs the rose] It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be... [stops] grounded?
That could be up to you.
Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right. [begins walking] Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?
Seems a little convenient, doesn't it? [stops and faces Kyle] Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!
Yeah!
Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!
Hi, is Kenny home?
Forward, men! [the bearers try to fit Cartman through the door, but they can't fir through. First they run into the door frame on the left side] That, no- [then on the right] No, you- You've gotta turn me. [the bearers tilt the litter some seventy degrees without Cartman falling off and finally fit through the door.]
I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?
You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.
Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!
That doesn't even make sense.
You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! [Stan and Kenny look at each other, then Stan thinks a minute]
Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.
Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help. [picks another yellow rose for Gates] But I hope that we're clear that this is my army. [hands the rose to him. Gates sniffs it] There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.
Your CEOs?
Uhhh, hmmm. What?
Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
[nose in left hand] He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and he what??
Because, because what? Because he's cute?
But what does he do besides that he's cute?!
Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom! [she turns around and goes back inside. Cartman reconsiders] Mom? [she looks back at him] Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. [she walks out of view]
He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!
So what are you saying, Kyle?!
Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?
Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.
We know a way inside the Red Robin. [this stops Stan, Jimmy and Craig] You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.
[Cartman's portrait, anime-style with a beard, voices over as Kenny reads the note inside the invitation.] Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King.
Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.
I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors. [reaches out for a yellow rose]
Well, think about it. [hands the rose to Stan, who takes it] The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by.
Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-
Dude! Dude!
Dude, shut the fuck up!
He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.
God damn it, shut up!
Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what Prometheus was about while you're at it?!
Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.
[sighs] Kyle thought of it. [Stan bolts out of there] Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude! [with Stan not returning, Cartman looks at the homeowner] You're a fuckin' asshole!
I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!
Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?
Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé.
Yesh, kewl.
Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.
Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?
Yes, he did.
[shushes Kyle up and walks him a few steps] It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.
What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!
Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s. [all cheer] And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.
Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit. [leaves the table and goes to the mall-side entrance, where Clyde is keeping watch] What have you found out?
Oh okay, that could be a while. [turns away from the door] All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit.
Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?
What the hell is this?!
Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!
Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!
Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!
They're not a part of your betrayal?
No. Whose betrayal is this? [the sound of chains comes from the mall entrance - Stan locks the doors, then turns around]
Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.
[flatly] Yay, XBox wins.
We'd like to get XBox Ones please.
The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.
You guys wanna p-play outside or something? [the boys glance around at each other. Soon the sliding door opens and the boys walk out onto the back yard]
I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.
The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?
Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this. [grabs a stick from the ground] We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!
[holds the stick up high in the sun] Fuck 'em!
You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?
[recognizing him] Uh oh.
I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.
Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but, Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde.
Dude, since like, noon or 12:30 today. [next shot is of Clyde walking down the hall with Lisa on his arm as he looks at his phone's screen. Everyone turns and stares at the new couple. They stop at Token at his locker]
Whoa, look at Bebe! [her picture is shown] I had no idea Bebe was that hot.
Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons.
Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest.
Protruding vaginal boner.
Oh, I like that. [the bus rolls up and the boys get on board]
Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!
Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!
You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys! [runs up to Stan's door and enters the house. He runs into Stan's room] You guys, I've got it!
It's the greatest startup company name EVER! [Kyle and Stan move in closer to Cartman]
Washington. Redskins. [Kyle and Stan look at each other]
It's sooo sweet!
It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!
Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!
Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!
[climbs down the ladder and joins Stan and Kyle] It's a strong name, dude. It's like agressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.
We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys! [walks up to an easel with a 4 Point Plan on it] Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down.
I told you guys! "Washington Redskins" totally gets people's attention!
Sittin' on our asses, here we come!
[on a video on the Kickstarter site] By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge.
Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself. [Butters walks across the room] Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye.
Yes, I know.
Oh, cool. Please take a seat.
Nice, I like that.
Stop? But why?
Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually. [phone rings, Eric reacts] Um, Butters, could you get that?
How is it offensive?
Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company "Washington Redskins," it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. [grins, knowing that's not the reason.]
Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself. [the men, dejected, turn and walk out the door]
Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!
Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!
Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about! [pounds the desk a couple of times.] Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are! [pound] Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!
NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!
It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.
Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!
Well that's fine! You can't call yourself "Washington Redskins!"
Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?
Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?
Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. [Kyle and Stan walk out the door. Butters begins to follow them, but stops in his tracks.]
Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! "Fuck you." Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with. [An image of the office appears, with the new changes] To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting. [a pair of tits and male genitalia are added to the original logo, to much cheer and applause] Now when people hear the name "Redskins", they will immediately think "titties" and "balls". It's just a bold new way that we can say "We don't fucking care." Go Redskins! [cheering and applause]
Goooood morning, guys!
We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!
[tries to visit his page, but it's not coming up] What the hell? Can't find the server? [tries again] Kickstarter.com! [not found] Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!
What?!
Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?! [gasps] Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!
You song of a bitch!
You broke Kickstarter!
Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!
Well, somebody did!
[shocked] A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything! [begins walking out the door]
[steps forward] It is really sweet.
Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks! [the cheering and applause die down] How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.
You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest "fuck you" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo. [The neo logo comes up - it's two of the old logo, with titties and balls and penises, one taking the other from behind. This receives cheers and applause]
I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. [a brick flies in through a window and shards flow into the room]
Whoa, whoa! What?
[sighs and his voice drops] I guess we gotta go back to school. [they boys turn left and walk away, their heads hanging down. The protesters keep cheering until they're gone.]
How's it going, everybody?
Hey dude. Sup? [they encounter Token, Craig, and Jimmy.]
What do you mean? We're just... going to school.
Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-
Dude, people are pissed off at us.
Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?
You know what we gotta do, guys? [gets off the bleachers] We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party
Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!
Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.
Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...
What?
We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!
Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.
So who do we throw the party for?
You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.
You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.
"I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes."
Believe it, dude.
What the hell is gluten?
KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!
KYYYLE!
What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.
What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
[turns to his right side] There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.
Aunt Jemima. [stands up and walks over]
I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima.
I don't even know what that means.
Are you going to eat those pancakes?
Oooo, trippy...
They've got what backward? [everything vanishes into a gray field, then a golden triangle appears, then shatters. A kaleidoscope of kids appears, taunting him. Aunt Jemima's face shatters, revealing the golden triangle.]
[he falls through his dream, surrounded by everything that has gluten in it] Noooo... [and suddenly wakes up] Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes.
KYYYLE!
KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS!
My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.
What, what is it? What is it for?
It's upside down.
Sir, the pyramid is upside down.
Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.
Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. [takes a couple of steps and notices the ghost of Aunt Jemima over a fence. He waves at her. She waves back.]
[thinking] Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago. [looks down at Stan's feet, than at Kyle's] Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all. [Stan notices and looks. Cartman notices Stan and shoves his hand further into his pocket. Stan looks at Cartman and steps away from him.] I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! [Kyle notices Cartman's anger]
[brightens up] Yeah I'm good. How are you, Kyle? [settles into angry funk again and thinks] They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time. [Kyle and Kenny look at each other, then they look at Cartman] We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess.
Good for you. [tries to get into the first stall, but finds it locked]
No! God damn it no! [pounds on the door] Who's takin' a shit?!
I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!
Son of a bitch! [moves on to Stall 2, tries to open it, and finds it locked too.] Oh no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time!
ALL RIGHT THAT DOES IT! [turns around and walks toward the door]I'M SICK OF THIS SHIT AND I'M NOT [throws his magazines to the floor] GONNA BE TAKING IT ANY LONGER! [reaches into his jacket pocket] You all pushed me to this! [pulls out a pink bow and plops it on to his hat, then continues out the door. Butters just looks on. Cartman leaves the boys room and enters the girls room. Wendy and Bebe are at the mirror. Wendy is quick to notice, and then faces him. Cartman heads for a stall and Wendy block him]
I'm going to the potty.
Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.
Did you notice the bow? [points to it] I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way. I have to take a shit. [barges into Stall 1, locks it, drops his pants, and sits down. Wendy shrugs with her palms up. The first poop falls and Wendy and Bebe recoil] Aaahhh!
Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy! [drops another deuce] Oh wow, this is nice in here. The girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys. [groans to get another deuce out, followed by a fart. Red comes out of Stall 2]
Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago.
It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too. [farts and poops some more]
Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girl's shitter.
Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl.
That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
Erica.
All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers.
There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.
Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.
Okay, okay, okay you guys! You know what? You know what? [drops a deuce] That's what. [laughs his ass off. Principal Victoria walks in behind the girls] Suck my clit and balls.
I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem. [poops and farts]
Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?
OH MY GOD!!!
Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.
Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out.
Oh on that side?
Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.
[rushes up] It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please. I gotta go. [opens the door, looks inside and grins. Inside is one of the fanciest restrooms one will ever see. Icicle lights all around, waterfall to the left, fancy commode to the right, plush towels and toilet seat cover. Triumphant music plays] Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome. [closes and locks the door] Aha! Lock! Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good! [claps twice - he's got the Clapper feature in there. The lights dim and Vivaldi's Spring begins to play] Perfect. [reaches over for a cat-o-five-tails and begins whipping the toilet with it] Yeah, you're gonna take it. You're all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you're gonna open wide. [the kids nearby just stand there shocked] You're gonna TAKE your punishment! That's right! Get ready! [remembers there are people outside] Oh my God, this is so awesome you guys! It's just like at home!
Yup! You know what Hillary says: "You can suck my clit and balls." [goes into his bathroom]
Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!
DUDE, THIS IS MY FUCKING BATHROOM!
I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!
Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT A CHICK WATCHING ME GO POO!
NO! I IDENTIFY AS A CHICK, BUT I'M STILL A BOY. YOU CAN'T MAKE ME SHARE A BATHROOM WITH A GIRL THAT IDENTIFIES HERSELF AS A FUCKING DUDE! [thinks for a few seconds] That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!
[runs up to Stan] Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog!
Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?! [Stan looks around] Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! STAN-AN'S A GIR-RL! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! [walks away]
HEY, WHAT THE FUCK DUDE?! GOD FUCKING DAMN IT!
Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?!
He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!
Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!
At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?! [the other kids agree, but not strongly] What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!
Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!
I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded. [pulls off his bow and throws it to the ground.]
[opens Butters' door and enters] Hey douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?
[heads for Butters' bed] Oh goddamnit, nobody's doing anything kewl! [gets on Butters' bed and lays down on his back.] I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid!
No it isn't.
That's stupid.
I'm dying of boredom.
[sits up, suddenly interested] What did you say?
Your dad has a fucking drone?
Whooaa! [runs up to it for a closer look]
[pulls his finger back and smiles at Butters] You wanna take it out for a spin?
[runs up to Butters and stands next to him] Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone!
Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know.
Okay, good idea. [picks up the drone] We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!
Oh shit, it's your dad! Go go go! [leaves the garage with the drone as Butters faces the source of the call, then pulls down the garage door] I'll see you later at my house.
Butters, is that you?
[opens the door just a crack and peeks out] Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?!
Alright, come in. [opens the door to reveal Kenny] Kenny's here; I told him all about it. [Kenny waves hello]
It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out. [outside, the drone sits in the grass in the backyard, 50 feet away from the house. Suddenly it rises to 23 feet, above the boys' heads, then veers to the right] Dude, no way! This thing is so epic! [the drone's camera shows some backyards through a fish-eye lens. A dog barks up at it from below.]
Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards! [in the distance, Kenny's house is shown from the back two blocks away. The drone veers to the right and drops down a bit, headed for a back door] Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house!
Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh. [Craig is shown at his computer. The drone moves to the next window and shows Craig's mom undressing.] Craig's mom is taking off her clothes.
Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush!
This thing is recording, right?
Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that? [Craig's mom has heard the drone and called her husband Thomas over. She stands behind him as they both look at the drone outside their window] Oh shit, dude! Bail! Bail! [thrusts the controller at Butters]
His dad sees you!
Fly back to the house, stupid!
Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone!
Not a word, Kenny!
Hey you guys.
You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush?
Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out? [whips out his phone]
You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.
[shows Stan] Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro.
Oh. Um, uh... Kenny? [motions for Kenny to get closer, but Kenny doesn't budge] Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny?
I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it.
Whoa, Butters, chillax bro.
Butters-
Butters. Butters.
Butters, I had to! [Butters lets him go] Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!
Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass! [they leave the restroom. Stall 1 opens and Kyle steps out, angry at what he just heard]
What? [the drone returns and goes the other way]
What does that have to do with me?
Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.
You were what?!
You were spying on me?!
But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!
You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy! [another drone hovers by]
Butters.
Because, Butters-
[brushes Butters' hands off his jacket] Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay- [stops and kneels down to see if there's anyone in the stall, then gets up again] Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video.
Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. "Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one."
Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from Hunger Games butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!
Oh hey Butters. Sup?
Dude, what's the matter?
Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here. [takes Butters in and closes the door]
Butters.
[while Butters speaks] Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.
Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.
Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.
Your dad's drone.
Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!
[with the controller] Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff.
It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom. [he gets the drone going. It rises, pulling behind it a blow-up doll made to resemble Laura, with a large bushy wig over the crotch. The drone and doll hover away from Cartman's house.]
Well, you see Butters, everything worked out. [Butters doesn't respond] "Oh, thank you Eric. I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass."
[taken aback, then sighs] Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy.
You're welcome. [the minstrel begins to sing again]
[approaching wit Kenny] What are you two boners doing?
I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.
How much money did you micropay today, Stan?
Yes.
Jimmy told me about this game.
The?!
Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!
It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!
[approaches Jimmy and grabs him by the shirt collar] And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!
That makes sense.
It's done. [he had been texting on his phone]
The word is out. [shows him the phone] "Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts." I tweeted it. [glances at his phone's screen] It's trending.
Cool.
[hidden around the corner, in front of the camera] That's awesome, Butters. [snickers away from the walkie-talkie] Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now? [snickers away from the walkie-talkie]
Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I- [mutes the walkie-talkie and whispers] He's so fucking stupid. [un-mutes it] But I'm sure they will soon.
[watching him from around the corner] Butters, no! Are you crazy?!
What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!
You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??
You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!
Alright Butters, sit down at the computer. [Butters does this] Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!
Welcome back, dude.
How do you feel? Do you feel okay?
And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, "Whoa, I'm back." [pounds his left fist on the table] Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever!
Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture!
Thank you, Kyle.
Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!
Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.
Right Butters. [softly over his left shoulder] These guys are so dumb, huh?
See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.
Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?
Even 10% is good enough. Here you go. [hands him the headset and Butters puts it on.]
[picks up the walkie-talkie] Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now. [presses a few keys on the keyboard] Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?
[turns off the room light so the fluorescent lights stand out] Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, [raises the shield]Mark. [quickly hides in the closet as Butters gets accustomed to the headset again]
All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.
Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.
You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.
Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.
Just take the money, Butters! [Butters reaches for the bill and takes it.]
You got the money? [Butters walks down the walkway as the lady closes the front door] Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point.
Yeah Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back. [eats some more chips] Are you heading back Butters? [no reply.] Butters? [Butters goes home] Alright Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.
[getting worried] Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.
Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.
Oh shit! [runs outside] Butters! Butters, where are you now?
Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?
Wait, hang on Butters!
Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
Butters?? Butters?? [turns the walkie-talkie off]
Butters. [Butters looks to his right. Dramatic camera pan from Butters to Cartman, who stands on the window sill like Morpheus]
Are you okay?
I'm not here, Butters.
This is going to be hard to understand, Butters, [climbs down to the floor] but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this... [spreads his arms out] is real.
Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality. [pulls off the missing thumb trick.]
You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam. [pulls out a wand from his sleeve and produces a bouquet of flowers from it]
Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.
[pressing a buzzer] How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? [hides under the bed]
Butters.
I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet! [performs another trick in which he gets a coin inside a glass bottle... and succeeds]
I'm happy that I totally got away with it. [gets a call] What's a 911 area code? Hello?
With what?
[slowly] Fuck you!
Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.
Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.
[sighs and squeezes his eyes shut for a moment] Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now.
Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you! [Well...]
Are you fucking with me?!
Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!
Because if you are, it's not cool!
Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!
Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!
That's right!
THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?
Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER! [Butters is alarmed]
It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool. [the doorbell rings and he answers. It's Kyle.]
I know. Let's go to the backyard. [turns and walks to the backyard. Kyle is quite surprised by Cartman's reaction. Moments later they takes seats at the picnic table out back. A butterfly floats by]
Okay Kyle.
Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?
[laces his fingers together, with his index fingers making a steeple in front of his lips] Mmmhmm.
And why did the guys send you, Kyle?
Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.
I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.
Calm down.
In virtual reality, yes you did.
You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!
[defeated] Fuck!
Or if I did?
What? [takes the phone from Kyle] Hello?
Dude. NOW this is getting weird!
[still lost] No, you guys. This is virtual reality.
Because... I'm a computer program.
I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.
I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.
You guys! [the boys look at him] I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!
Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer. [Stan does this]
[takes a flier] What's this?
[looks at Craig.] Girls volleyball? [they both laugh at the thought] Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy.
Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay? [hands the flier back to girl 1] All right.
Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.
This asshole needs to make a move already!
He's playing an enchantment.
Dude, it was complete brutality!
At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!
Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this! [the janitor finally looks at the group] It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!
Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.
[steps forward and watches him leave] Kewwwl!
What's hardcore and exciting about Shitty shrimp? [they approach the doors]
Dude, do we look like police?
Five dorrah?! [Mr. Lu Kim hushes them quickly and leads them to the back room, which leads to the basement. Lu Kim opens the basement door]
Dude, that was total carnage!
Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?
We're going again on Friday, right?
What's the matter Kenny?
You feel bad for the roosters?
Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.
Huh? A little bit?
What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys. [Kenny just looks at his meal]
Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play "Magic: The Gathering"?
Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?
Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh, Kenny?
What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about "McNuggets"?
[mimicking a rooster] "Yes I do, you guys." [normally] Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?
[through gritted teeth] Come on, McNuggets! Fight!
All right, McNuggets!
[carrying McNuggets in a small cage] That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular "Magic: The Gathering" look like girls' volleyball.
Thank you so very much.
You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!
We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.
Oh Jesus, give it a rest already.
OOHHH!! [laughs with the other boys]
[aside, to Stan] Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that.
Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time. [they stand before Panda Express. Again, Kyle knocks on the doors and tugs at them.]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic.
Ten dorrah?! [the boys hand over $10 each]
Who is that??
Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!
McNuggets is scared, dude!
This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.
Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!
Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack.
Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.
Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an Overseer.
Ah, dude, your dad's here.
It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.
Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?
He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?
Hey bros, what's going on? This is CartmaaanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already, 'cause subscribing makes you feel good! Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start. [a recording of the earlier conversation plays]
That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
[reaches for some chips and eat them, chuckles, then] Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
There's Kenny commenting on Call of Duty. Kenny! Kenny! SPEAK UP!! SPEAK THROUGH THE HOOD KENNY!
Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty.
More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start.
That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
[reaches for some chips and eat them, chuckles, then] Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
God these guys are so annoying, aren't they? CartmaaanBrah!
Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle.
That's what they're called, dude. Get with the times. [turns to the basket and takes his shot. Kyle looks away and down]
Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah!
CartmaaanBrah!
Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.
CartmaaanBrah!
CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs.
Hey hey, how's it going, bros? This is CartmanBrah. CartmaaanBrah. And uhh, we are, it looks like we are at the bus stop now. [the other three boys walk into view] Yep, there's Kyle, Stan and Kenny looking stupid as ever.
Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again. Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah!
[exasperated] Oh God.
Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated
Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!
[his commenter window pops up] Looks like we're in the school now. Check out Wendy, she's flat as a pancake.
Oh my dick's gettin hard again! It's protrudin' out my paaaaants!
This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.
Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.
[mocking] There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying.
[mocking] This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something.
What the hell did I do?
Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.
Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.
[in his commenter window] Ohohoh, totally, brah! So sweet. Being in charge of stuff rules! CartmaaanBrah!
Ooohh, I love whole new levels! This is gonna be so totally awesome! CartmaaanBrah!
[his commenter window pops up on screen] Ahem, how's it going brahs? This is CartmaaanBrah!
CartmaaanBrah! Dude, check it out. Lady Gaga is singing Christmas songs. Isn't she a Jew?
He's such a douchebag.
Now we're talkin'! [the commenter window disappears and Stan and Kyle are stunned]
Ehey hey, how's it going bros? This is CartmaaanBrah! And it looks like we're in the producer's office in Los Angeles now. [eats some chips]
Look at that guy. He's like 40, but he's got a Justin Bieber haircut.
No, it's not good, it's fuckin' awesome!
I can hear you, douchebag.
These guys are such blumpkin catchers.
G'dang g'dang! G'dang g'dang g'dank!
[his commenter window pops up] Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off. CartmaanBrah!
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible.
How do you even know I'm here in my room?
...Very impressive, Kyle. But the holiday special is beginning soon. I'm afraid I can't let there be any distractions. [Kyle tries breaking his way into the room] You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws. [Kyle stops]
Why does that matter?
What?
Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah. [the commenter window disappears]
Oh, this should be good.
I'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered.
Hoh, this should get some comments. [Kurt's hologram fires the rifle and a small flag saying "Merry Christmas" pops out. He grins]
Oh bros, weak!
Oh weak, bros, so weak!
[his commenter window appears] Oh wow, where are we now, brahs? [the family looks at him] This looks pretty stupid.
CartmaanBrah!
[his commenter window appears] Oho, looks like we've reached customer service, brahs. Now we can truly be everywhere!
[his commenter window appears] Yes, with every passing second I become more powerful.
[his commenter window appears] Happy holidays, everyone! [the cops stop laughing and look at the window] Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah.
Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah.
I am trending so much that soon I will reach... trendscendence. Like Johnny Dep, but cool.
It's all CartmanBrah now. [a shot of Times Square. Cartman's image replaces everything else on the screens there] I am trending into something more than human. I am becoming... transgender. [a shot of the Times Square crowd, looking at the screens in disbelief] Now they will HAVE to give my my own bathroom!
Hey! What's going on? What is that? [amid some special effects of snow and holly popping out of the upper right corner of screens everywhere, PewDiePie's commenter window appears]
What the hell?!
Ey! Get out of here, PewDiePie! This is MY holiday special!
Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie!
Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...
No! You can't do this!
God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-!
NOOOO! [his commenter window disappears, as well as the holiday special]
Sweet dude!
I've already got four days of detention. I don't want anymore. I'm gonna start following the rules.
[sighs heavily] Tom Brady.
Deny and subvert.
Everybody shoplifts. Why are you coming down on me?
A perfect storm of hypocrisy that everyone in the country has to deal with for months on end.
[pacing back and forth] You're right, guys. I'm gonna Tom Brady this thing!
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say "You're not giving me four day of detention! You're only giving me one!"
NO! No, to hell with that! "You're giving me NO days detention! And then I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife! Who's not even that hot, and kinda looks like a dude!" [marches off]
[turns around] Thanks, guys. I almost forgot the lessons that football has taught us all. I can get around these pesky rules. Butters, I'm going to need your underwear. [walks off]
Oh, PC Principal, how are you today?
You know, I think you and I got off on the wrong foot the other day. By all means, please, keep your dick out. You see, I'm not going to accept four days of detention and... you're going t'apologize publicly for being so strict to me and my friends at school.
It's just a request, that's all. See you around. [stops and looks down] Oh, you seem to have dropped something, PC Principal. [picks it up] What's this? Why, this is a little boy's underwear. [sniffs at it] Why, this is Butters' underwear.
PC Principal, you have Butters' underwear and now... [drops it into the urinal and soaks it in PC Principal's urine - the principal had not flushed the urinal - and pulls the briefs out.] Oh my gosh, it's got your DNA all over it. [through some windows above the urinal, Kyle, Butters, Craig, Stan, and Token watch the action unfold] This certainly doesn't look good for you. I don't need to tell anyone about this. No, I think we have an understanding. Capiche?
You mean about keeping your dick out?
Oh-kay. Look, you don't want to end up like the spokesman for Subway, so you?
Okay, let's back up. [...and slams him against the stall] Aaah!
[quuickly] No, I'm sorry. I was just trying to frame you for raping Butters!
Oh God!
[with raspy voice] We can't beat him, you guys. PC Principal is too strong.
There's nothing left to do. I'm going to admit I did something wrong, take my punishment, and move on. I'm not Tom Brady.
No way.
Because PC Principal is right, Kyle. You and I are bigots, and it's time for us to grow up.
If I can face my prejudice, why can't you? We're two privileged, straight white boys who have their laughs about things we never had to deal with.
[In added pain] Aaahh, aahh! [looks left at Kyle] Kyle, believe me! I know the struggle with hatred. Let's make ourselves better people... together. [reaches out to Kyle]
No more fat-shaming, Kyle. Let's start a new chapter.
No. I'm going to call you... my friend.
I... guess we never realized how bad he really was.
Ack! Butters!
Oh Butters, I've lived such a horrible life! Always doing whatever I want and claiming it to be for integrity. BUTTERS?
I'm never going back to the person I was. I swear to God. From now on the world is going to know a new and better Eric Cartman.
OH. Eh, oh it's no use, Butters. I want to get out there and start making positive changes, but I... can barely even walk. [thinks a moment] How is everybody doing?
Who?
[soft music plays] ...Kyle? ...My friend Kyle? [begins removing his hospital clothes slowly and replacing them with his own clothes]
I don't have a choice. I have to take these PC people out.
I do, but I have to help Kyle, even if I don't agree with his hateful, bigoted thoughts. Kyle's view may be warped. I personally think Caitlyn Jenner's a stunning hero, [clears his throat] but that doesn't mean I'll stand by while Kyle's intolerance is dealt with violently. We're going to war with these PC people once and for all! Butters, I'm going to need 200 pregnant Mexican women and some taco launchers.
All right, send in the pregnant Mexican women! [Butters, with a semaphore flag in each hand, gives the signal for the women to rush the house]
Fire the taco launchers! [the boys load the launchers and let fly. Tacos rain down upon the frat house. The women arrive and run into the house, picking up tacos on the way] Syrian refugee children, flank from the left! [a truck load of Syrian refugee children is waiting for the truck bed to empty out. Butters releases the cargo door and the kids flood out towards the house]
[looking through some binoculars] The Syrian refugee children are in; send in Jared! [Jared appears with his arms stretched out, ready to grab anything. He follows the women and the kids into the frat house, but doesn't grab anyone. The rest of the neighborhood gathers and marches towards the house]
All right, good. The pregnant Mexican women are falling asleep on the tacos. [sees Jared on the balcony trying to grab some kids, and some bros stop Jared] Jared needs backup, send in the Chinese drivers. [a split second later two cars crash into each other in front of the house.]
All right, the Syrian refugees are trying to protect their children! Gimme a- Oh fuck, there's Kyle. [lowers his binoculars] What the fuck are you doing, Kyle?
Yes. But at least we showed him that sometimes joking about un-PC things can actually be important, because it starts a dialogue. [Kyle lowers his eyelids and the others back away] What's wrong, Kyle? You have your cake. Eat it, too.
Hmmm... And who does that remind you of, Kyle? Now if you don't mind, I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife. Who, kind of looks like, a dude. [Cartman hums his own version of the end theme song over the credits.]
You guys, I think this whole thing is a conspiracy.
Think about what happened: American has pretty secure border for years. Kyle gives a big speech about tolerance and acceptance that goes viral. A bunch of Canadians cross the border illegally. Kyle's brother is Canadian. What if Kyle knowingly gave that speech to get all the illegals in?
And he's sitting right here.
[interrupting] Yeah, yeah, this is interesting. Have you guys read Genesis Thirty-four?
Well, it's intriguing, because in Genesis Thirty-four, the Jews actually did something similar to what Kyle is doing now.
But it's happening a lot more now. After you decide to give a big speech about Caitlyn Jenner. Because you want to bring down the cultural fabric of America. 'Cause you're a Jew.
Yeah, I'm out.
Guys, what if this was all exactly what Kyle planned? Get the Canadians here, make them feel persecuted, and then what? Uprisings? Rebellion? Next thing you know, they're sending us to camps and using us as livestock!
Yeah, we're gonna need a symbolic union.
You know, what's that story about the two sides that were fighting and, then a guy from one side got with a girl from the other side and their love sort of brought the groups together?
[snaps his fingers and points to Butters] Yes, Lion King II. I mean, if we can get one of us to go out with one of them - probably, have sex - then it could be a symbol of us all getting along.
Is he seriously? Is he seriously giving a speech right now? [all quiet] Is he SERIOUSLY giving a speech right now?! [the other boys look back at Kyle angrily, and Kyle is left speechless] This is gonna have to happen pretty fast, so whoever's gonna do it needs to ask a Canadian girl out soon. 1 2 3 Not it.
What about that one? In the glasses? She's kinda hot.
All right, how about the lanky one, there? Ooo, ooo, What about the one in the hat? She kind of looks like Alanis Morissette, huh?
Okay, Bu-Butters, relax.
Okay. Do you just want a race war?
Okay, go fuck the one in the white shoes.
[satisfied with the way Butters interaction is playing out. To himself] And start a pride all of our own.
Have you given her the old Hot Cosby yet?
Butters, we don't have time for that! I told you you have to cut to the chase with a Hot Cosby!
Nobody cares about forty years from now when she suddenly changes her mind, Butters! Time is of the essence! We're all gonna die! [hangs up. Butters returns to Charlotte]
Dude!
Because apparently he doesn't care that his jokes are at the expense of actual people.
No. [steps forward] Hey, we are not bumpkins! Okay?! Kenny's a bumpkin!
We don't have junk cars in our yards, that's just your family, Kenny! [Kyle is about to defend Kenny, but Stan speaks up]
Are the Mexicans actually staying?
Oh, thank you. And, uh did I mention I am a food critic for Yelp?
Okay, I just didn't want you caught off-guard. [whips out his phone] I was thinking of giving this place 5 stars.
[wiping his mouth clean with his napkin] Yeah, but I'm kind of teetering on 5 stars or 1 star.
Ah I mean, I could probably be persuaded with some free desserts.
Great, and can you turn down the music a bit? [taps his left ear a few times] This pagan shit hurts my ears.
Oh hey, hey busboy. Busboy busboy, por favor. [snaps his fingers and whistles] Busboy!
Ehexcuse me?
Uhh, it's actually pronounced "David," okay?
It's "David," dude. Look it up.
Mmmhmmm! [The father takes them to a booth near Cartman]
Oh God, now everyone thinks they're a food critic.
[wearing a T-shirt that says "WARNING: YELP critic" on the front] Here you go. [takes a bag out of his back pocket and hands it to Butters]
Crispy risotto bites from Olive Garden.
I'm a restaurant critic, Butters. I get whatever I want.
EEWW. [Kyle and David face him] What's the busboy doing here?
Oh, cool. Are you gonna clean the tables here too? How do you get to school? [mimics a boy on a bicycle] Do you ride your tiny bicicleta? Huh?
Look amigo, I'm sorry I only gave your parents' restaurant two stars, but it could have been worse.
I'm sorry, but the food totally messed my stomach up. The morning after I ate it I went to the bathroom and my poop was all solid. Like no water at all.
It was like this one solid piece that I had to... push out my asshole. It was like being raped from the inside. Your parents' restaurant just wasn't up to my standards, David.
David.
David.
David David David David! I can update this to a one-star review in two seconds, dude. [David turns around and walks away. Kyle turns around, looks at Cartman, and follows David away. A few second later Cartman relaxes] ...Oohhhh God I love being a restaurant critic.
Uhuh, I'm a food critic, Butters, okay? I can't just eat cafeteria food.
Well, you are a little late, like, I dunno, maybe only [emphasis] one star late.
Sounds good. Now get the fuck out of here.
Yes, no no, you you're right, Kyle. I'm not important. Oh, hey David, I was just wondering, um, how do you get to school? Do you... ride your tiny bicicleta? Eh?
What? I just want to hear him say "Sí, me ride me tiny bicicleta to schooool."
[laughs] That's awesome! [turns around on the bench] I'm gonna go out to recess. Will you bus this for me, David. Thanks. [leaves the table. David leaves his seat]
Hm hm hm the fuck? [notices a small puddle on the floor] Aw, dude, somebody spilled shit on the floor! [notices David at his locker] Hey David, somebody spilled something here. Could you clean this up, por favor? David. [whistles] Over here, there's some shit on the floor. [David closes his locker and turns away] Heyheyhey hey! What's goin' on, man?
What are you talking about? I'm the most influential critic in this town. Okay David, forget the spill, just give me one little "My name is David. Me ride me biciceta to schoool"
[whips out his phone] Okay, I'm uh I'm updating my review. I'm about to do it. [waits for a comeback but doesn't get one] You'd better say "I ride me bicicleta to school"! [holds up his phone] One star! ... No s-no stars? [no reply. He sighs and tries again] No stars? ... You can't just treat me like I'm nothing... I still know I'm worth something! Come on, guys! [walks away. No one follows him. Seconds later he's back.] Oh yeah, y-you guys stay in school, that's kewl, you guys stay here. [leaves again]
[hops onto Butters' bed and lays down] It's all over, Butters. Everything I've worked so hard to achieve. All these hack wannabe food critics have made my profession a joke.
All these people trying to be like me. And they don't even write about poop consistency the next day.
I guess.
[sits up] You're right, Butters. Maybe I can actually use all these people somehow to make... real food critics respected again.
Not a part, Mom. I've invited all the poser food critics over for a meeting.
It's not fun, it's serious. These people think they can do what I do, but they need to be, made to understand the reality. When the Yelpers get here I need you to get lost, okay? Okay, that's them, that's them. Go, get lost, Mom! [she goes away as he walks to the front door. He opens the door and sees a sea of reviewers]
Fuuuuuuck! [closes the door and keeps it closed with his back] Mom!
But Mom, there's like a billion people here.
Oh, this many people have nothing better to do than write reviews on Yelp?!
Mom, there's a fucking billion people here! [yes, Yelpers all up and down the block, filling the streets all around. Moments later, he appears at his bedroom window on the second floor, and holds court] Uh, thank you all for coming. My name is Eric, and as you know, us Yelpers are being scrutinized-
Yes. Us Yelp critics are being scrutinized.
Now, you see, the problem is that when there's too many reviewers, people no longer know who is the real food critic. [Sgt. Yates puffs up his chest, pretty sure that it's him] It's great that you all want to be critics, but we all know who the real food analyst of the town is.
Okay. So, as long as there is one clear leader, then the rest of you can just follow. And with this many people all following [holds up index finger] one captain, we can fight to get our power back!
So now rise up, and [pounds on the window sill] fight for your leader!! Fight together and show the restaurants that our food critic does matter!
[just shrugs] It didn't do well with Yelpers.
Oh come on, admit it. The food sucked.
Look, I'm sorry goys, but Whistlin' Willy failed to recognize the influence someone like me has on their business. Now, I just have one question for you, David. Do you ride... your teeny, tiny, bicicleta... to school?
Yeah, I'm done! I'm now the leader of thousands of people! They all hang on my every word! [softly] And I'm gonna use my power to finally get what this town really needs.
Oh, hello David! [Cartman is flanked by hundreds of Helpers]
...wanted special privileges, but these people think I should have them! Right, guys? Maybe I don't deserve special treatment, but how else can I be the elite food critic they want? [more chatter]
Why thank you, David. That's good service.
Mmmm, is that a jalapeño cream sauce?
Hmmm. It's tart, but savory.
[voice shaking terribly] Yes, I was just trying to do my job as a food critic and they all ganged up on me and said I was fat.
I was in the locker room. I was in my underwear and these kids walked by [Craig and Clyde appear around the corner] Then I looked in the mirror and I thought I looked kind of ripped, and so I asked one of the kids [Clyde] if he would take a picture of me [holding two dumbbells, one in each hand] and he did. And I looked at the picture and I looked pretty ripped, so later at home, I put the picture up on my Yelp account and I typed in "Don't I look ripped?" and I thought people would be stoked on me. Then this morning I saw the comments on Twitter and some people called me names and said I wasn't ripped, and they said that I was fat and I didn't have muscles. The Internet made fun of me and [is overcome with emotion and hyperventilates. PC Principal sniffs and clears his throat.]
I said you were perfect because you're really good at getting all your schoolwork done on time [gathers his thoughts] so you'd probably do a really good job.
I'm not a joke!
I wanted someone smart and hard-working!
There you are. You have my social media comments?
[reviews them] Mm-hm. Hm-oh, that's nice. Oh great. This is all the Twitter comments?
Okay, nice. Oh ni- oh, very enthusiastic. This is so great! [turns around and walks by Kyle, who's at his locker.] Oh Kyle! You thought me having someone edit my social media would make me look stupid? You should see all the comments I'm getting. People are actually really stoked on me now.
Butters!
[at the bedroom door] What the hell is this? The last report you gave me has a comment that says "This picture of you burned my eyes, fatso!"
What new people? [walks up to the computer]
Dude, fuck Demi Lovato! She's fuckin' hot, she's not being fat-shamed!
Butters, I want this fixed by tonight, you got that!
Everyone likes me and thinks I'm great in my safe spaaaace.
[eating in a restaurant, Butters hands him more comments] People don't judge me and haters don't hate in my safe spaaaace. [Butters is hard at work]
Bully-proof windows.
People that support me.
More people that support me.
Bully-proof windows. [a change in tempo and a masked villain enters the video.]
What? Who is that?
I'll take care of him, Demi! [shoots lightning from his hands, and the various people in their safe spaces are now dressed to dance!]}}
Our safe spaces will keep you out!
But Reality we can do without!
Bully-proof windows.
That was nice.
Hey Kyle. You wanna see what people said about my dick pic? Everyone's pretty stoked on it.
Uh oh.
[thinking] Dude, Tweek and Craig. It's just so weird. If they've been gay this whole time, have they been checking me out? I'm pretty sure Craig has seen my wiener. Should I kick his ass?
I just don't understand it, Cupid Me. Wanting to like, kiss a dude?
I guess, just because I don't understand it doesn't mean I shouldn't support it. Alright. Maybe you can help them along.
Yes, Cupid Me. Make it quick, and don't let anyone see you.
Did you do it, Cupid-Me?
[laughs] That's awesome! [chuckles as Cupid-Me flits to his left side] That's so sweet.
Yeah, dude. You're hilarious.
[his smile vanishes] Stop that, Cupid Me. I told you I'm not homosexual, okay? It's not funny.
Yep. School tomorrow should be really interesting.
[runs up to them] You guys! You guys, hurry!
It's, It's Tweek and Craig, dude! They're about to have sex! [runs off. Stan and Kyle follow.]
Oh-ho come on, you guys. Get a room. [Craig and Tweek start fighting. Soon Cartman grabs onto Kevin for support]
[sets his phone down, takes the bouquet, and reads the attached note.] "Can't we just try? Tee Hee." Oh man.
Someone who needs a real talking to.
Look, it's flattering, okay? But it doesn't change the fact that there's nothing here for you to keep pursuing.
You are wasting your time. I'm not attracted to guys.
I realize that, but I'm sorry. I need you to stop bothering me. [the smile leaves Cupid Me's face. Cartman's voice gets quieter] This... is done. I'm just not a homosexual. [dejected, Cupid Me goes limp in mid-air.]
What are you doing? This place isn't you. [Cupid Me is shown, with a mug of beer an empty scotch glass, and an ashtray full of cigarette butts.]
No I'm not. I'm here because we need you right now.
Fuck you.
The whole town is sad. Cupid Me, you have to help.
[hushed shouting] I'm not homosexual!
Ugh. Alright, one date. But only if you help get Tweek and Craig back together.
Oh, hey, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa. I'm not here for me, I'm here for my friend, okay? [the bartender doesn't see any friend with him]
[in bed, moaning in a rhythmic fashion] Okay, okay, the date's almost over.
It's fine. It just doesn't really do anything for me.
Cu- Cupid Me, no! No, I'm straight!
Cupid Me, what are you doing?! Oh my God! [next, he's in the bathroom. Liane walks past, but stops to listen in] Oh Cupid Me, that's enough! Okay, that's it, Cupid Me! That's it! [Liane opens the door and sees Cartman masturbating furiously on the toilet] That's it, Cupid Me. Okay, that's it. That's it, Cupid Me. [Liane closes the door]
You guys! Oh my God you guys! You guys, they're gay! [Butters catches up] They're totally gay!
Kenny and Token.
Kenny and Token, dude. They're so gay. Butters told me.
No dude. In those old abandoned buildings around Kenny's house, Kenny and Token turned it into a big ninja clubhouse. And they dress and play ninjas in it trying to scare people away.
It's the gayest thing ever dude? Ninjas are fuckin' dumb! Dude, come one! We've gotta go see this!
[in hushed tones] Oh my God they're so gay you guys.
Ah, no, we're good, thanks. [in hushed tones] Oh my God this is a sausage party!
[sarcastically] Yeah, I'm sure they are. [a big truck stops in its tracks.]
That's pretty cool.
Totally dude, ninjas are sweet.
[catches up to a ninja] Dude, can I talk to you for a minute? Listen, I don't think we should let Kyle be a ninja, okay? He said ninjas were gay. He's probably gonna try and turn it around on me, but that's 'cause Kyle knows I heard him.
Yeah, cool... it's me, Butters.
I'm just, I'm just Butters, man. I have problems with lots of things.
Yes I do, Butters. [kicks him in the nuts and walks away]
Yeah, we're pretty bad-ass, and um, this is, like, our fortress, and you can see it's really cool.
Yeah yeah yeah, and it's like, we can do whatever we want, and people are scared of us, it's totally rad!
Oh my God! I never said it was gay!
That is a total lie!! Why would I say anything homophobic about the way Tweek and Craig make love?! [points to Stan] He's a lying, backstabbing Jew!
So then, after you told me, we went over to Kyle and Stan when they were playing basketball, remember?
And we said Kenny and Token were playing ninjas, and Kyle said that ninjas were gay, and I said ninjas are gay, but it was a question. You remember?
No nonono, see? Now Kyle got everyone remembering it wrong because he doesn't wanna get kicked out of the group. That's what Jews do when they get caught in a lie. You cannot trust a Jewish ninja, Butters.
Whoa, dude.
They're fuckin' ninjas, dude!
Ah, excuse me. Can I just set the record straight on something?
Should Jews be trusted? [no response. A few seconds later...] Uh I mean, if one of us is a Jew, do you see that as being at all problematic?
YES! [dances away] YEEES! ["Can't Touch This" begins to play and Cartman does arm waves.] Oh—oh, oh—oh! Oh—oh, oh—oh! What did I tell you guys?
You guys, I know this is hard for all of us. But to truly be ninjas, we must face hard facts. Last night I spoke in private with our ninja leader overseas. We talked a long time about Jews and the Hebrew faith. He told me a lot I didn't know. And I was able to tell him some things he did not know. But after talking with that guy, it is abundantly clear to me that Jews cannot be ninjas. I went to Kyle's house to talk to him about it, and I found this. [pulls out a drawing of two ninjas, one of them having anal sex with the other one] It was then that Kyle confessed to me about how he had brainwashed Butters and Stan into thinking I had used a homophobic slur to refer to our organization. And he almost got away with it. That's when Kyle tried to kill me. Luckily I was the faster ninja. [reveals the, uh, guilty ninja, who's strapped into a chair and his ninja head covering is duck-taped over his face] Kyle knew I would never call ninjas gay. When I take the gag off, he's going to try and tell you that I'm lying now. Do not believe him. Kyle is a liar.
[looks at the group, then at the bound ninja] Who, who is this?
...and I am Token. Why do I do these things, you ask? Black rage.
Oh, I get the misunderstanding now. No, see, I told Clyde that Kyle said ninjas were gay, but Clyde thought I was Kyle, so then he was saying that I said ninjas were gay, meaning I as in Kyle.
No! You CAN'T kick me out! I have to be a ninja! They hate Jews. I was made for this, you guys! Please!
I told you guys. What did I tell you? I said ninjas are fuckin' gay but you didn't wanna listen, nooo!
[yawns and whispers to Kyle] Oh, my fucking God...
I'm so bored, dude.
I am not your slave, Kyle.
[laughs] PC Principal wants to see you, Kyle!
Have fun, dude.
Yeah, and wasn't Jimmy the one in charge of the school newspaper? So who's putting this out?
How do you hate the Internet? That's like hating titties.
How does it do that?
That movie's gonna suck dude.
Eating ice cream, dipshit.
And then Token tells Clyde that if his mouth was a bank, Clyde's mom would have already deposited her dick in it. Which is hilarious because Clyde's mom is dead. [the boys burst out laughing again]
Didn't we finish doing that?
Why isn't anyone looking at me?
Stan's calling you a traitor.
I am loving this right now.
Hoh that's low. [smiles]
Fight! [the kids gather round to watch. Half of them are cheering them on, the other half stay quiet. Nathan stops by to see what's going on.]
What?
Who would use a Cosby joke to push their own agenda?
So what do we do now?
Kyle, even if we thought it would help protect us, how are we all gonna get our hands on guns?
Alright, cool, we got guns. So now what?
Hey! Don't fall too hard, partner. [Kyle smiles and walks off. Cartman poses with his gun] Do I look sweet, Butters?
Yeah, I just want finish this movie.
Mom, I'm into this movie. I'm not going to bed right now. Chillax.
I will go to bed [stands up and aims his gun at her] when this movie is over, Mom!
Turn off the light and go back to bed. I'm staying up.
I don't think so, Mom.
No means no, Bill Cosby!
Whoa, Mom, what the hell?
Mom, put down the gun.
Okay, I am going. [walks around her, keeping his gun trained on her.]
I'm going to bed now, Mom. Chillax. [begins to go up the stairs backward.]
Okay, I love you too, Mom. Night-night. [the sound of a door closing is heard]
That's a nice gun right there.
Yes, dude!
[opens the door and enters] You wanted to see me, PC Principal?
It's "Skankhunt42" and no I am not.
Unfortunately, that'd be a breach of my civil rights, but I can assure you, nobody respected you girls' poignant protest more than I did.
Fellow students, as you know, an Internet troll by the name of Skankhunt42 has been harassing women and girls by making degrading comments on our school message board. The girls are very upset, and many male students believe that it's just because girls don't have a sense of humor. I beg to disagree. Girls rule, women are funny, get over it. Just the other day, in the hallway, I heard two male students saying how the new Ghostbusters sucked balls. I was shocked and appalled. It is time for us all to realize and accept that girls are cool, and women are funny. Wendy? Wendy, could you come up here, please? Come on up, Wendy. Wendy Testaburger, guys. [some of the kids clap, Wendy stands up and walks over to Cartman] Wendy, go ahead. Be funny. [he holds the mic to her face, and she looks at him warily. He tried harder, she leans farther away] Say something funny, Wendy. We can't wait.
Hey, girls are funny, Wendy. Okay? Get over it. Just do women's comedy stuff. You know, talk about how fat you are and how you wanna have sex with guy and then say "my vagina" a lot..
And that's just the kind of sexist bull-crap that's gonna keep you in the kitchen. Sit your ass down. [Wendy goes back to her spot on the gym floor] This isn't a joke, you guys. Girls are funny. Bebe, why don't you come up here? Come on, Bebe.
No? Come on, talk about havin' sex with guys, and say "vagina" and stuff like that. Go ahead. [looks her over quickly] Girls rule, women are funny. Bebe, get over yourself. Seriously.
[moves away] Huh. Oh my God, that wasn't really all that funny. That's weird. Um, let's see. Red? You have any zingers for the crowd? No? How about you, Nelly?
K, that wasn't really funny, it was just angry.
K, that's good, now just try to say it a little funnier now.
Okay, and then, and then, and then just go, "my vagina."
[enters] Hi guys! [takes a seat] Are you all ready to hear a story?
This was a book I created all with my imagination. It's called "Little Red Riding Kyle. The story of a little gay boy and his adventure with four hilarious women. One day, Little Red Riding Kyle was walking through the forest thinking about guys. He was on his way to visit his grandma, who was a little black boy named Token." Get over it. "But then, a big bad wolf who was a hilarious woman named Janet walked into the house and said 'I have a large vagina' and traded place-" [Kyle enters and pull him out of the room.]
Rebooting fairy tales to try and ease the friction caused by Internet trolls.
Why would I do that, Kyle?
[from a distance] Help! [the other boys see him as he runs to them] Help me! Augh! Aw! [reaches the other boys]
A bunch of girls! They cornered me in the gym! They said all boys needed to pay! They kicked and they hit me and, and they kept me down and drew this vagina on my face! [well, it's there, but with a pair of testicles attached to it] They said it was to send a message!
Yeah. See, here's the top of the vagina and there's the balls. [Kyle has lost interest] It's starting, you guys! None of us is safe anymore!
Yeah, no, they do! Vaginas totally have balls! Right?
What do you mean? If vaginas don't have balls, what do they have?
[opens the door and comes in] Hey broship. Got a minute?
You were right, Kyle. Okay? I drew the vagina on my face. I tried to fool people, but you keenly noticed my one tiny error in that girls don't have balls.
Kyle, you have to try and appreciate what I'm doing. I know that a war is coming between us and the girls. I knew it the moment they sat out the National Anthem.
Suppose for one second that I'm not Skankhunt42. And that I really have been doing what I've been doing to try and stop the damage he has done?
'Cause I'm scared, Kyle. I don't know if you've noticed, but race wars are back. And now if we get gender wars too??
Yeah but... you can't track down an Internet troll, [peers down into the toilet] it's too bad.
Totally, you guys; this has gone far enough. [Kyle looks unimpressed.] The girls are really pissed off at us. [He drinks from a milk carton.]
You hear that guys? It'd better not happen again tonight! [Kyle still looks unimpressed.] I am so, seriously.
'Sup dudes?
[Stands up excited] Are you serious?! All night broship Counter-Strike party? That's fucking sweet! Does your uncle's cabin have good wifi?
Bros!! Dude, that's so awesome! This is gonna be the best night ever!
This is gonna be so awesome. Just hanging with the bros playing Counter-Strike all night. Alone in the woods - you pumped Token?
I'm totally gonna do some massive pwnage. Whoever's on my team will be stoked. My laptop's so fast it doesn't lag at all. I can jump around like a pwnage powerhouse.
You guys all seem kinda, like, bummed out. Is everything cool?
Okay, cool. Goin' a long way to play Counter-Strike. Guess it's sweet though there won't be any adults to screw it up for us. How much further now?
This place has sweet wifi, right? Gon' be so awesome.
Oh, dude, is this it? This is cool. So isolated. [Camera shows a hole and shovel in the ground] Check it out, there's a shovel next to a hole dug in the ground.
Dude, is this where we're gonna play? I call dibs on this side! What's the wifi called? Is there a password?
I don't see it - I don't see it coming up on my laptop. I don't know, I think maybe the wifi's not working. Where's the box? [Cartman picks up his devices]
You gotta unplug it and plug it back in. [Turning around] You guys? You guys...? There's...no wifi...
What are you...What are you guys talking about - What-
Oh my God. Oh my God, you guys are gonna break all my stuff so I can't get online!
Please! Please don't break my stuff you guys! This is like, 2 Christmases and a birthday worth of stuff! You guys can't do this! Please!
No, don't-get-it-over-with! Don't break my stuff! I'm not SkankHunt, I'm not! You guys, you guys, you don't have to do this! You-don't-have-to-do-this! We can still just play Counter-Strike, and forget everything! Oh-my-God, there's no wifi - We can use my phone, to make a hotspot and we can still play Counter-Strike! And it'll be sweet! You guys, come on, please! Please, you can't!
Please, Clyde! Clyde, you're my friend! Please, y-you know how much - I - need - my - stuff!
No please! If I can't get online, I won't-how would I-I- Mumbling.
No, God! No! Don't! Don't!! Don't!! Oh my God!!
Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Aahh!! Niah!! Niaah!! Iaahh!! Iaahh!! Niaaahhhh!!!
[Off screen.] Iaahh!!
Heidi? Heidi Turner?
Where? [she turns and walks off to her left]
The park?
[begins to cry] I miss my stuff.
For what?
You weren't the only one. I guess I didn't deserve a second chance. I really tried to make changes. I really tried to become a better person. To sh-show that I was trying to listen.
[earnestly] Women are funny, Heidi. Get over it. Every time Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I lose my fuckin' mind.
I don't have any friends. I don't know if I ever did.
Kewl.
Hey. [long pause] I was thinking again. About how women are just as funny as men. And then I realized... that the only way to really be sure is to see if African-Americans think they're funny.
Because, black laughs matter.
Yes, it is.
Yes, you do. [Heidi just looks downward] Heidi, does it ever get any easier? Living in this world?
You wanna go somewhere? I'll follow you. [Heidi smiles]
Yeah. It's the best, dude. Try it.
Yeah. I think I am too. Heidi, can I ask you something?
Do girls... not have balls?
So when a girl goes to scratch her balls, how does that work? [she wonders why he's asking] I just don't understand what's at the bottom of a vagina.
...Holy shiiit.
[looks at Kyle] Hey, Kyle.
Cool. That's cool.
I saw a vagina, Kyle.
I'm not holding a grudge. I'm happier now. I have purpose.
My girlfriend's. She stood six feet away and flashed it really fast. But in that instant, you know what I saw? I saw that humankind can colonize Mars. I saw the potential of our species to terraform other planets and reach the infinite.
[stands up and talks to Heidi] Of course you did 'cause you're amazing. Look at what I made you.
That's what my baby wanted.
[puts the necklace on Heidi and faces Kyle] Oh sorry. Heidi, you know Kyle?
Oh either way, we totally can. I, I guess Kyle has something to talk to us something about first, um. [talks to Kyle] Go ahead, Kyle.
He said something about us working together to take down Butters.
I'm not sure, Boo. [faces Kyle] Could you start from the beginning, Kyle? [faces Heidi] Heidi is amazing at figuring stuff out.
[talks to Kyle] You want to know what's really going on? I'll tell you what's going on. Even though women have made great gains in the last century, there are still a part of men who aren't comfortable with women having power. It really just comes down to that, and then you have social media which allows men to anonymously say horrific things like "Women aren't funny," even though Heidi's like the funniest person I'be ever met.
[talks to Heidi] No, it's true. Get over yourself.
I know. You don't have to 'cause you're awesome.
[talks to Kyle] Like mess with Butters how? [lifts mug] What do you mean "mess with Butters"? [drinks from mug]
[gets mad] Oh I see! You have a problem with Heidi.
You're threatened by her because she actually has interesting things to say and she is funnier than you.
[talks sarcastically] Oh she's not funnier than you, [speaks with anger] or is she just not funny because she's a girl?
[talks to Heidi] Sorry, babe. It just really ruffles my feathers.
[talks to Kyle] Look, Kyle, we're just out of it now.
Humans on Mars.
[walks from the girls side of the fight to the in between Nelly and Butters and spreads his arms] Hey hey hey! Whoa, guys! Guys! [crowd stops yelling] Hasn't this gone on long enough? Aren't we tired of being so divided at skewl?
It's cool, Baby.
Heidi has been really hurt by all of this, you guys. And I think it's time for us to all try to come together, as a skewl.
Hey you guys?
Guys, we have a lot of problems facing our skewl. I don't know if many of you know Heidi but she's really smart and really funny.
You are. And she's come up with a pretty cool idea. Tell 'em, baby.
Yeah, but the way you said it was actually way funnier, remember?
Remember, you were like "Oh, what if we had a fundraiser?" in uh, what was it? [they hold hands] Remember, you- it was like uh-
Yeah, we were having uhh, that dessert thing. What was that, that-?
Yeah, yeah, remember? Remember that there was that, that guy that had that, what was it
Yeah yeah yeah, that's when you said that- don't let anybody- [they get lost in the moment for a few seconds whispering to each other. The other kids lean forward trying to understand what they're discussing. Cartman notices, then] Oh hey guys. Wha-what's up? Oh right. A school fundraiser. Tomorrow, we'll be going to each individual class with more information. And after that...
[almost whispering] It's awesome. You're doing awesome.
We can work together hand in hand to make the whole world understand that
Put our difference aside, feeling hope now feeling pride.
And then maybe everyone can finally be as happy as we are.
Terraform Mars.
It was a great idea. [spots another car driving by] Hey! Hey, buy a Danish for Denmark?
What?
Heidi! [follows her]
Don't say that.
Because you're smart and funny, that's why. It was a great idea, Heidi. [puts his hand on her shoulder] I think that somehow... trolling is playing a bigger part in this than anyone even realizes.
People of Denmark, we know that you've been the victim of trolling. So have we. Maybe we can help. I'm not sure if you know my girlfriend Heidi but... She's really smart and really funny.
[whispers] You are, babe. Stop it.
[whispers] Go on, babe, just tell them. Tell them.
[jumps] Whee! [waves at someone far away] Hi! [looks at a human city] So cool! [leaps towards the city]
Hi! [stops and sees a roller coaster] Dude, Mars rules. [leaps to the roller coaster] Mars rules!
Just thinking about how much we could accomplish if... people weren't so close-minded.
[sighs] He's not a bad person, Heidi.
You're right. You're right, Heidi.
[opens the door halfway and leans] Hey, Broship. You got a minute?
Just a second. Please, Kyle?
Okay, [walks with Heidi in the bathroom] come on, Baby.
Kyle Kyle, I know you haven't had a serious girlfriend, but you've stop caring about seeing each other in the bathroom.
[walks away from the toilet] I remember not that long ago, Kyle, when you told me in this very room I believe, that you were going to prove who the troll was no matter what. Do you remember that, Kyle? Where's that Kyle?
[walks to the sink] No no, I know. Being in groups is great; you get to gang [opens sink draw and grabs Lysol spray] up and smash people's stuff, pull up your wiener in the cafeteria. [sprays Lysol at Kyle and walks near Heidi] I wonder what the old Kyle say about this Kyle. I wonder if old Kyle would be pretty disgusted right now by who he's become. Heidi's been working with Denmark now, Kyle. I want to show you what she's done. It's gonna change the way you think.
Like you said what you would do, Kyle, except she actually meant it.
She's funny too, Kyle.
You're not giving her credit for being hilarious.
Hey man, can we have a quick chin wiggle? Look, the other day when you said Heidi wasn't funny, that was pretty lame, man.
Oh my God, will you let it go?! Why do you have to have this hangup against women?!
You do, Kyle! You have to think about the things you say! They matter! [turns to leave]
Yeah, to catch trolls.
[a look of fear crosses his face] Well, Heidi doesn't actually use the Internet. We've sworn off that stuff, so it's kewl.
[thinks for a moment] ...Uh oh. [the recent past flashes through his mind, stopping off at the moment he saw Heidi's vagina in his room with the lights out, then moving on to the day he saw Ghostbusters]
No, it sucked! I'm gonna send Butters an e-mail right now. [whips out his phone and types] "Dude, don't bother with new Ghostbusters. Totally not funny. Chicks ruined it." [puts the phone away] Can we get ice cream now? I wanna get the taste of ass out of my mouth. [fast forward to the present]
How can they make what I said on the Internet available to the public? That's bullshit!
I gotta go! [runs out]
Not kewl! Not kewl! [holds onto a rock and sees someone caught in the storm, flying away] Not kewl! [tries to walk to the station]
It's all falling apart! Weak!
I-I, I don't know.
It's just hard.
And I do. [breathes heavily] This one time, [wipes his nose] I think it was over the summer I went to see the new Ghostbusters movie.
And, and during the movie I was like "Wait, where is my phone?" and I couldn't find it; and then Jimmy said "Ha ha ha, screw you, Cartman," and he was holding my phone and he ran off with it and said, "I gonna send a bunch of texts and emails from your phone so that everyone thinks it's from you,"; and I was like "No, that's not cool!" and he said "Yeah," and he said a bunch of mean stuff before I went to go get him and I took my phone back; and I'm just worried th-that people look at my Internet history, they're gonna think all that stuff came from me!
So you totally believe me?
Hey hey Butters, can I talk to you?
[walks in] Do you remember an e-mail I sent to you a few months ago, after I saw the new Ghostbusters movie? In which I might have said something to the effect of it totally sucking balls because women aren't funny?
I just need to see exactly what I e-mailed you, Butters. And then I need you to e-mail me saying what an awesome prank that was e-mailing you "Ghostbusters sucked balls" when actually I told you it was really funny several times in person.
A traitor?
Sticking with my kind? You guys broke all my stuff!
Please do not call her that, Butters. I really like her.
Yeah. Neither did I.
You can't stop believing that. Now more than ever you have to stay strong.
You are smart, Heidi.
[getting emotional] You're funny. Oh my God, when Amy Schumer talks about her vagina I seriously lose my shit.
Yes, Heidi. For the first time I'm really scared for the future.
Heidi? Heidi!
Sorry, I have to talk to you. It's really important.
Heidi, we... have to get to Mars.
No, Heidi, we have to get to Mars like, now. [walks around a bit] I've seen what's gonna happen when Trolltrace goes online. I think... a lot of people have said and done things online that will make a lot of other people angry and, it's going to be very bad. Humankind is going to destroy itself and its only hope are the people who go to Mars, where there's no wifi. So nobody can see what anybody said or did on the Internet, ever.
Yes. [walks up to hold her hand] Heidi, I think there is. But you have to totally trust me, and know that I'm doing this to save... us.
That's kewl.
We aren't gonna see home again, babe. We're gonna make it. There's no turning back.
Yes. I do. [before them is SpaceX]
Hello. I understand that you're trying to get to Mars. This is my girlfriend, Heidi. She's really smart and really funny.
We've given up social media and we'd like to be somewhere as far from the internet as possible. Is it true Mars would have really shitty Wi-Fi?
Well, we'd like to go. We can't tolerate this world anymore and we'd like to talk to whoever we can about getting to Mars as soon as possible please.
What others?
What the fuck, dude?!
Ah god dammit, is that Cher?!
Jesus, I didn't think getting to Mars would take this long.
I know, but it'll be worth it, babe. We'll be left alone to make our new world better.
[speaks to Butters] What the hell are you doing here?
Oh no no no! You're a male chauvinist sexist pig, Butters. You don't get to go to Mars.
Butter, Butters! You expect people to believe that you went from being the biggest asshole in the school to a softhearted feminist like me? Fat chance.
Yeah? You just forgot one thing, that women are funny too. That didn't occur to you, did it, Butters?
Yeah, I mean, when women make vagina jokes I think it's the funniest thing ever!
[looks at Heidi, then at Butters, then in a low voice] Oh, I see what you're doing.
Oh nothin', babe. I'm just... Do you think you could tell me some jokes?
Because you're [glares at Butters] fucking hilarious.
[leaves with Heidi] Oh, finally.
Oh great, a stupid tour guide. Can we just talk to someone important please? We want to go to Mars.
[whispering to Heidi] They already have Pizza Pockets.
Excuse me, Mr. Musk, this is all super interesting and shit, but can we see the Mars rocket now?
Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what about going to Mars?
No, no nonono, we have to go now!
[walks to Heidi with mug] You got it figured out yet, babe?
Heidi, yes you do. You just have to get over yourself. Come on, say it. Say it.
[does a one-sided hug on Heidi] Get over it, baby. Stop holding yourself back.
[yells at Elon Musk] What the fuck do you want?! [talks to Heidi] Hang on, babe. [runs towards Elon Musk]
Just give her a chance. [turns around] She's the smartest, funniest girl on Earth.
Yeah, [points at his own head] that's because you have a mental block, Elon Musk. [lowers his arm] They won't let you get over yourself.
[faces Butters with a mad face]
[enters the men's room and sees Butters using the urinal] What are you doing?
I mean what are you doing here calling my girlfriend funny? You better back off! You don't even know her, your just saying it! How do you even know she's funny?!
Butters, Heidi is everything to me. If you take her, I swear to god...
What are you talking about?
Not Heidi, she's different. She's really smart, and really funny.
[walks away in shock]
[walks towards Butters and then leans against the railing] I just don't understand it. She's always been really smart before. And hilarious.
[Yells] Nobody's been duped! Stop suggesting that she's being manipulative. Why would she want to trick me?
[turns around and yells] That's ridiculous. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Heidi is the smartest, funniest person I've ever met. I'm not being tricked. And I'll prove it to everybody!
[Nervously] Hey, babe. Uh, how's it going?
[Wipes his nose] Okay, cool. Uh, babe, you remember that funny thing you were saying about soup the other day. What was that again?
Do you--you remember that funny voice you did at McDonald's? You were like "Could you--Could you hand me my water," or something. I can't--I can't remember.
Or the time you said the thing about clouds and I was laughing so hard--What was that again?
Okay, okay, now could you just do the "my vagina" thing for them? Could you just say "my vagina"?
What the fuck is happening?
Conniving, snakes-in-the-grass. All of them.
We have to tell someone the truth, Butters.
It's all been leading up to this, we've just been too blind to see it before.
Maybe just a moment alone, to talk?
The end of our species.
Listen, there isn't much time. This whole thing has to be stopped. We can't go to Mars.
I've had visions of Mars for the past few months. I'm a visionary. That's why I came, why I brought her.
But the visions weren't complete until recently. I know what happens on Mars.
Everyone will be really nice.
Hi!
You'll think the rover cars and roller coasters are really cool.
But then, you'll realize something--The other colonists all seem to be women.
Hmm, let's see
And then you'll start to wonder, "Where are all the other guys?"
And soon, you'll realize there's areas you didn't understand the purpose for.
What is this place?
And that's when you'll learn the truth...
Men have been forced underground, deemed useless by women.
They are mined for the only things women still need us for, our semen, and our jokes.
What?! No, no!
You're just as funny as us! You don't need to do this!
Nooooooo! No, no!
No! No!
And you'll be trapped down there forever, in the cum and joke mines of Mars.
If there's even a little part of you that really doesn't believe that, then think about what else has to be going on.
You have to help us stop this!
Elon, I know you've dreamt of mankind getting to Mars, but its not going to be very kind to man. They're going to put us underground.
What's the one thing women don't have? Semen and a sense of humor.
They're pretty related.
Oh, Elon. Oh, Christ, Elon.
It's something they do to our brains. They attract us like flies to the spiderweb. And then they make you think they're really smart, really funny. But they're only really smart, Elon.
They can live without us. We can't live without them.
If even 1/16th of you believes that women might not be as funny as men, Elon--[He turns around and notices that Elon isn't there.] Elon?
What the hell am I going to do, Butters? Semen and a sense of humor. I can't live without Heidi. I know I'll be miserable. But I also can't live on the cum and joke mines of Mars.
If I stay on Earth where the internet is, Heidi finds out I know women aren't actually funny. And if I go to Mars, I get milked like a goat.
[He is heard over Kyle's phone.] Is that Kyle?
[He takes Butters' phone.] Kyle, do you mind? I'm having really big girl problems right now.
Attention all SpaceX employees. [Elon Musk and his group turn away from the energy source chamber and look up.]
Please evacuate the building immediately. [A group of men working on Tesla cars stop and hear the announcement.]
We just received a bomb threat from NASA. This is not a drill. [Heidi walks over to Cartman from behind.]
The NASA terrorists are super-jelly of us. Please quietly and calmly find the nearest exit and get the fuck out as fast as you can. [He notices Heidi.] Ah! [He puts the microphone away.] Oh, hey, babe. Wh-What's up?
Oh yeah, I was just...They told me on the stifernisy thing. It was spinning. Come on, we better get out. [He grabs Heidi and runs with her to the energy source chamber before she stops him.]
Distant? Really? Oh my God. I-I'm sorry.
[He grabs Heidi's hands.] No. No, Heidi. Why would you think that? [He then turns her away, so she doesn't see what's going on with the chamber.]
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, go on.
Uh-huh. Yeah, cool. Heidi, I'll always do what's best both of us. [He puts his arm around her while looking back at the guys.]
Now come on we got to get outside.
Well, looks like you're gonna have to kind of start over, huh, Elon?.
Maybe you should just go back to your little cars, huh?
Yeah, well some people's dreams are other people's nightmares.
It was a joke.
